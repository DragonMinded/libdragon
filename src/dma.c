/**
 * @defgroup dma DMA Controller
 * @ingroup lowlevel
 * @brief DMA functionality for transfers between cartridge space and RDRAM
 *
 * The DMA controller is responsible for handling block and word accesses from
 * the catridge domain.  Because of the nature of the catridge interface, code
 * cannot use memcpy or standard pointer accesses on memory mapped to the catridge.
 * Consequently, the peripheral interface (PI) provides a DMA controller for
 * accessing data.
 *
 * The DMA controller requires no initialization.  Using #dma_read and #dma_write
 * will allow reading from the cartridge and writing to the catridge respectively
 * in block mode.  #io_read and #io_write will allow a single 32-bit integer to
 * be read from or written to the cartridge.  These are especially useful for
 * manipulating registers on a cartridge such as a gameshark.  Code should never
 * make raw 32-bit reads or writes in the cartridge domain as it could collide with
 * an in-progress DMA transfer or run into caching issues.
