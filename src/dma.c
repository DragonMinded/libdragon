/**
 * @defgroup dma DMA Controller
 * @ingroup lowlevel
 * @brief DMA functionality for transfers between cartridge space and RDRAM
 *
 * The DMA controller is responsible for handling block and word accesses from
 * the cartridge domain.  Because of the nature of the cartridge interface, code
 * cannot use memcpy or standard pointer accesses on memory mapped to the cartridge.
 * Consequently, the peripheral interface (PI) provides a DMA controller for
 * accessing data.
 *
 * The DMA controller requires no initialization.  Using #dma_read and #dma_write
 * will allow reading from the cartridge and writing to the cartridge respectively
 * in block mode.  #io_read and #io_write will allow a single 32-bit integer to
 * be read from or written to the cartridge.  These are especially useful for
 * manipulating registers on a cartridge such as a gameshark.  Code should never
 * make raw 32-bit reads or writes in the cartridge domain as it could collide with
 * an in-progress DMA transfer or run into caching issues.

 * @brief Check whether the specified PI address can be accessed doing I/O from CPU

 * accessed via #io_read and #io_write.

 *  * 0x1000_0000 - 0x1FBF_FFFF: cartridge ROM
 *  * 0x1FD0_0000 - 0x1FFF_FFFF: no known PI peripherals use this
 * 
 * The rest of the 32-bit address range is only accessible via DMA.
 * 
 * Notice also that the range 0x2000_0000 - 0x7FFF_FFFF is theoretically accessible
 * by the CPU but only via 64-bit addressing, so it requires assembly instructions
 * (as the libdragon toolchain uses 32-bit pointers). No known PI peripherals use this
 * range anyway.
