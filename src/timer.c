/**
 * @defgroup timer Timer Subsystem
 * @ingroup libdragon
 * @brief Interface to the timer module in the MIPS r4300 processor.
 *
 * The timer subsystem allows code to receive a callback after a specified
 * number of ticks or microseconds.  It interfaces with the MIPS
 * coprocessor 0 to handle the timer interrupt and provide useful timing
 * services.
 *
 * Before attempting to use the timer subsystem, code should call #timer_init.
 * After the timer subsystem has been initialized, a new one-shot or
 * continuous timer can be created with #new_timer.  To remove an expired
 * one-shot timer or a recurring timer, use #delete_timer.  To temporarily
 * stop a timer, use #stop_timer.  To restart a stopped timer or an expired
 * one-shot timer, use #start_timer.  Once code no longer needs the timer
 * subsystem, a call to #timer_close will free all continuous timers and shut
 * down the timer subsystem.  Note that timers removed with #stop_timer or
 * expired one-short timers will not be removed automatically and are the
 * responsibility of the calling code to be freed, regardless of a call to
 * #timer_close.
