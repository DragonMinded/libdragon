 * # RSP Queue: implementation
 * 
 * This documentation block describes the internal workings of the RSP Queue.
 * This is useful to understand the implementation. For description of the
 * API of the RSP queue, see rspq.h
 *
 * ## Architecture
 * 
 * The RSP queue can be thought in abstract as a single contiguous memory buffer
 * that contains RSP commands. The CPU is the writing part, which appends command
 * to the buffer. The RSP is the reading part, which reads commands and execute
 * them. Both work at the same time on the same buffer, so careful engineering
 * is required to make sure that they do not interfere with each other.
 * 
 * The complexity of this library is trying to achieve this design without any
 * explicit synchronization primitive. The basic design constraint is that,
 * in the standard code path, the CPU should be able to just append a new command
 * in the buffer without talking to the RSP, and the RSP should be able to just
 * read a new command from the buffer without talking to the CPU. Obviously
 * there are side cases where the synchronization is required (eg: if the RSP
 * catches up with the CPU, or if the CPU fins that the buffer is full), but
 * these cases should in general be rare.
 * 
 * To achieve a fully lockless approach, there are specific rules that the CPU
 * has to follow while writing to make sure that the RSP does not get confused
 * and execute invalid or partially-written commands. On the other hand, the RSP
 * must be careful in discerning between a fully-written command and a
 * partially-written command, and at the same time not waste memory bandwidth
 * to continuously "poll" the buffer when it has caught up with the CPU.
 * 
 * The RSP uses the following algorithm to parse the buffer contents. Assume for
 * now that the buffer is linear and unlimited in size.
 * 
 * 1. The RSP fetches a "portion" of the buffer from RDRAM to DMEM. The size
 *    of the portion is RSPQ_DMEM_BUFFER_SIZE. It also resets its internal
 *    read pointer to the start of the DMEM buffer.
 * 2. The RSP reads the first byte pointed by the internal read pointer. The
 *    first byte is the command ID. It splits it into overlay ID (4 bits) and
 *    command index (4 bits).
 * 3. If the command is 0x00 (overlay 0, index 0), it means that the RSP has
 *    caught up with the CPU and there are no more pending commands.
 *    
 *     * The RSP checks whether the signal SIG_MORE was set by the CPU. This
 *       signal is set any time the CPU writes a new command in the queue.
 *       If the signal is set, it means that the CPU has continued writing but
 *       the RSP has probably fetched the buffer before those commands were
 *       written. The RSP goes back to step 1 (refetch the buffer, from the
 *       current position).
 *     * If SIG_MORE is not set, the RSP has really caught up the CPU, and no
 *       more commands are available in the queue. The RSP goes to sleep via
 *       the BREAK opcode, and waits for the CPU to wake it up when more
 *       commands are available.
 *     * After the CPU has woken the RSP, it goes back to step 1.
 * 
 * 4. If the overlay ID refers to an overlay which is not the currently loaded
 *    one, the RSP loads the new overlay into IMEM/DMEM. Before doing so, it
 *    also saves the current overlay's state back into RDRAM (this is a portion
 *    of DMEM specified by the overlay itself as "state", that is preserved
 *    across overlay switching).
 * 5. The RSP uses the command index to fetch the "command descriptor", a small
 *    structure that contains a pointer to the function in IMEM that executes
 *    the command, and the size of the command in word.
 * 6. If the command overflows the internal buffer (that is, it is longer than
 *    the number of bytes left in the buffer), it means that we need to
 *    refetch a subsequent portion of the buffer to see the whole command. Go back
 *    to step 1.
 * 7. The RSP jumps to the function that executes the command. After the command
 *    is finished, the function is expected to jump back to the main loop, going
 *    to step 2.
 *     
 * Given the above algorithm, it is easy to understand how the CPU must behave
 * when filling the buffer:
 * 
 *   * The buffer must be initialized with 0x00. This makes sure that unwritten
 *     portions of the buffers are seen as "special command 0x00" by the RSP.
 *   * The CPU must take special care not to write the command ID before the
 *     full command is written. For instance let's say a command is made by
 *     two words: 0xAB000001 0xFFFF8000 (overlay 0xA, command index 0xB,
 *     length 2). If the CPU writes the two words in the standard order,
 *     there might be a race where the RSP reads the memory via DMA when
 *     only the first word has been written, and thus see 0xAB000001 0x00000000,
 *     executing the command with a wrong second word. So the CPU has to
 *     write the first word as last (or at least its first byte must be
 *     written last).
 *   * It is important that the C compiler does not reorder writes. In general,
 *     compilers are allowed to change the order in which writes are performed
 *     in a buffer. For instance, if the code writes to buf[0], buf[1], buf[2],
 *     the compiler might decide to generate code that writes buf[2] first,
 *     for optimization reasons. It is possible to fix it using the #MEMORY_BARRIER
 *     macro, or the volatile qualifier (which guarantees a fixed order of
 *     accesses between volatile pointers, though non-volatile accesses can
 *     be reordered freely also across volatile ones).
 *
 * ## Internal commands
 *
 * To manage the queue and implement all the various features, rspq reserves
 * for itself the overlay ID 0x0 to implement internal commands. You can
 * look at the list of commands and their description below. All command IDs
 * are defined with `RSPQ_CMD_*` macros.
 * 
 * ## Buffer swapping
 * 
 * Internally, double buffering is used to implement the queue. The size of
 * each of the buffers is RSPQ_DRAM_LOWPRI_BUFFER_SIZE. When a buffer is full,
 * the queue engine writes a RSPQ_CMD_JUMP command with the address of the
 * other buffer, to tell the RSP to jump there when it is done. 
 * 
 * Moreover, just before the jump, the engine also enqueue a RSPQ_CMD_WRITE_STATUS
 * command that sets the SP_STATUS_SIG_BUFDONE_LOW signal. This is used to
 * keep track when the RSP has finished processing a buffer, so that we know
 * it becomes free again for more commands.
 * 
 * This logic is implemented in #rspq_next_buffer.
 *
 * ## Blocks
 * 
 * Blocks are implemented by redirecting rspq_write to a different memory buffer,
 * allocated for the block. The starting size for this buffer is
 * RSPQ_BLOCK_MIN_SIZE. If the buffer becomes full, a new buffer is allocated
 * with double the size (to achieve exponential growth), and it is linked
 * to the previous buffer via a RSPQ_CMD_JUMP. So a block can end up being
 * defined by multiple memory buffers linked via jumps.
 * 
 * Calling a block requires some work because of the nesting calls we want
 * to support. To make the RSP ucode as short as possible, the two internal
 * command dedicated to block calls (RSPQ_CMD_CALL and RSPQ_CMD_RET) do not
 * manage a call stack by themselves, but only allow to save/restore the
 * current queue position from a "save slot", whose index must be provided
 * by the CPU. 
 * 
 * Thus, the CPU has to make sure that each CALL opcode saves the
 * position into a save slot which will not be overwritten by nested block
 * calls. To do this, it calculates the "nesting level" of a block at
 * block creation time: the nesting level of a block is defined by the smallest
 * number greater than the nesting levels of all blocks that are called within
 * the block itself. So for instance if a block calls another block whose
 * nesting level is 5, it will get assigned a level of 6. The nesting level
 * is then used as call slot in both all future calls to the block, and by
 * the RSPQ_CMD_RET command placed at the end of the block itself.
 * 
 * ## Highpri queue
 * 
 * The high priority queue is implemented as an alternative couple of buffers,
 * that replace the standard buffers when the high priority mode is activated.
 * 
 * When #rspq_highpri_begin is called, the CPU notifies the RSP that it must
 * switch to the highpri queues by setting signal SP_STATUS_SIG_HIGHPRI_REQUESTED.
 * The RSP checks for that signal between each command, and when it sees it, it
 * internally calls RSPQ_CMD_SWAP_BUFFERS. This command loads the highpri queue
 * pointer from a special call slot, saves the current lowpri queue position
 * in another special save slot, and finally clear SP_STATUS_SIG_HIGHPRI_REQUESTED
 * and set SP_STATUS_SIG_HIGHPRI_RUNNING instead.
 * 
 * When the #rspq_highpri_end is called, the opposite is done. The CPU writes
 * in the queue a RSPQ_CMD_SWAP_BUFFERS that saves the current highpri pointer
 * into its call slot, recover the previous lowpri position, and turns off
 * SP_STATUS_SIG_HIGHPRI_RUNNING.
 * 
 * Some careful tricks are necessary to allow multiple highpri queues to be
 * pending, see #rspq_highpri_begin for details.
