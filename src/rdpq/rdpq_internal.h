 * @brief RDP tracking state

 * tracked by the CPU as it enqueues RDP instructions.Ã¬
 * 
 * Tracking the RDP state on the CPU is in general possible (as all 
 * RDP commands are supposed to go through rdpq, when it is used), but it
 * doesn't fully work across blocks. In fact, blocks can be called in
 * multiple call sites with different RDP states, so it would be wrong
 * to do any assumption on the RDP state while generating the block.
 * 
 * Thus, this structure is reset at some default by #__rdpq_block_begin,
 * and then its previous state is restored by #__rdpq_block_end.
