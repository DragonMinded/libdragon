 * # RDP Queue: implementation details
 * 
 * This documentation block describes the internal workings of the RDP Queue.
 * This is useful to understand the implementation, but it is not required
 * to read or understand this to use rdpq. 
 * 
 * For description of the API of the RDP queue, see rdpq.h
 * 
 * ## Improvements over raw hardware programming
 * 
 * RDPQ provides a very low-level API over the RDP graphics chips,
 * exposing all its settings and most of its limits. Still, rdpq
 * tries to hide a few low-level hardware details to make programming the RDP
 * less surprising and more orthogonal. To do so, it "patches" some RDP
 * commands, typically via RSP code and depending on the current RDP state. We
 * called these improvements "fixups".
 * 
 * The documentation of the public rdpq API does not explicitly mention which
 * behavior has been adjusted via fixups. Instead, this section explains in
 * details all the fixups performed by rdpq. Reading this section is not
 * necessary to understand and use rdpq, but it might be useful for people
 * that are familiar with RDP outside of libdragon (eg: libultra programmers),
 * to avoid getting confused in places where rdpq deviates from RDP (even if
 * for the better).
 * 
 * ### Scissoring and texrects: consistent coordinates
 * 
 * The RDP SET_SCISSOR and TEXTURE_RECTANGLE commands accept a rectangle
 * whose major bounds (bottom and right) are either inclusive or exclusive,
 * depending on the current RDP cycle type (fill/copy: exclusive, 1cyc/2cyc: inclusive).
 * #rdpq_set_scissor and #rdpq_texture_rectangle, instead, always use exclusive
 * major bounds, and automatically adjust them depending on the current RDP cycle
 * type. 
 * 
 * Moreover, any time the RDP cycle type changes, the current scissoring is
 * adjusted to guarantee consistent results. This is especially important
 * where the scissoring covers the whole framebuffer, because otherwise the
 * RDP might overflow the buffer while drawing.
 * 
 * ### Avoid color image buffer overflows with auto-scissoring
 * 
 * The RDP SET_COLOR_IMAGE command only contains a memory pointer and a pitch:
 * the RDP is not aware of the actual size of the buffer in terms of width/height,
 * and expects commands to be correctly clipped, or scissoring to be configured.
 * To avoid mistakes leading to memory corruption, #rdpq_set_color_image always
 * reconfigures scissoring to respect the actual buffer size.
 * 
 * Note also that when the RDP is cold-booted, the internal scissoring register
 * contains random data. This means that this auto-scissoring fixup also
 * provides a workaround to this, by making sure scissoring is always configured
 * at least once. In fact, by forgetting to configure scissoring, the RDP
 * can happily draw outside the framebuffer, or draw nothing, or even freeze.
 * 
 * ### Autosync
 * 
 * The RDP has different internal parallel units and exposes three different
 * syncing primitives to stall and avoid write-during-use bugs: SYNC_PIPE,
 * SYNC_LOAD and SYNC_TILE. Correct usage of these commands is not complicated
 * but it can be complex to get right, and require extensive hardware testing
 * because emulators do not implement the bugs caused by the absence of RDP stalls.
 * 
 * rdpq implements a smart auto-syncing engine that tracks the commands sent
 * to RDP (on the CPU) and automatically inserts syncing whenever necessary.
 * Insertion of syncing primitives is optimal for SYNC_PIPE and SYNC_TILE, and
 * conservative for SYNC_LOAD (it does not currently handle partial TMEM updates).
 * 
 * Autosync also works within blocks, but since it is not possible to know
 * the context in which a block will be run, it has to be conservative and
 * might issue more stalls than necessary.
 * 
 * More details on the autosync engine are below.
 * 
 * ### Partial render mode changes
 * 
 * The RDP command SET_OTHER_MODES contains most the RDP mode settings.
 * Unfortunately the command does not allow to change only some settings, but
 * all of them must be reconfigured. This is in contrast with most graphics APIs
 * that allow to configure each render mode setting by itself (eg: it is possible
 * to just change the dithering algorithm).
 * 
 * rdpq instead tracks the current render mode on the RSP, and allows to do
 * partial updates via either the low-level #rdpq_change_other_modes_raw
 * function (where it is possible to change only a subset of the 56 bits),
 * or via the high-level rdpq_mode_* APIs (eg: #rdpq_mode_dithering), which
 * mostly build upon #rdpq_change_other_modes_raw in their implementation.
 *
 * ### Automatic 1/2 cycle type selection
 * 
 * The RDP has two main operating modes: 1 cycle per pixel and 2 cycles per pixel.
 * The latter is twice as slow, as the name implies, but it allows more complex
 * color combiners and/or blenders. Moreover, 2-cycles mode also allows for
 * multi-texturing.
 * 
 * At the hardware level, it is up to the programmer to explicitly activate
 * either 1-cycle or 2-cycle mode. The problem with this is that there are
 * specific rules to follow for either mode, which does not compose cleanly
 * with partial mode changes. For instance, fogging is typically implemented
 * using the 2-cycle mode as it requires two passes in the blender. If the
 * user disables fogging for some meshes, it might be more performant to switch
 * back to 1-cycle mode, but that requires also reconfiguring the combiner.
 * 
 * To solve this problem, the higher level rdpq mode APIs (rdpq_mode_*)
 * automatically select the best cycle type depending on the current settings.
 * More specifically, 1-cycle mode is preferred as it is faster, but 2-cycle
 * mode is activated whenever one of the following conditions is true:
 *
 * * A two-pass blender is configured.
 * * A two-pass combiner is configured.
 *  
 * The correct cycle-type is automatically reconfigured any time that either
 * the blender or the combiner settings are changed. Notice that this means
 * that rdpq also transparently handles a few more details for the user, to
 * make it for an easier API:
 * 
 * * In 1 cycle mode, rdpq makes sure that the second pass of the combiner and
 *   the second pass of the blender are configured exactly like the respective
 *   first passes, because the RDP hardware requires this to operate correctly.
 * * In 2 cycles mode, if a one-pass combiner was configured by the user,
 *   the second pass is automatically configured as a simple passthrough
 *   (equivalent to `((ZERO, ZERO, ZERO, COMBINED), (ZERO, ZERO, ZERO, COMBINED))`).
 * * In 2 cycles mode, if a one-pass blender was configured by the user,
 *   it is configured in the second pass, while the first pass is defined
 *   as a passthrough (equivalent to `((PIXEL_RGB, ZERO, PIXEL_RGB, ONE))`).
 *   Notice that this is required because there is no pure passthrough in
 *   second step of the blender.
 * * RDPQ_COMBINER2 macro transparently handles the texture index swap in the
 *   second cycle. So while using the macro, TEX0 always refers to the first
 *   texture and TEX1 always refers to the second texture. Moreover, uses
 *   of TEX0/TEX1 in passes where they are not allowed would cause compilation
 *   errors, to avoid triggering undefined behaviours in RDP hardware.
 * 
 * ### Fill color as standard 32-bit color
 * 
 * The RDP command SET_FILL_COLOR (used to configure the color register
 * to be used in fill cycle type) has a very low-level interface: its argument
 * is basically a 32-bit value which is copied to the framebuffer as-is,
 * irrespective of the framebuffer color depth. For a 16-bit buffer, then,
 * it must be programmed with two copies of the same 16-bit color.
 * 
 * #rdpq_set_fill_color, instead, accepts a #color_t argument and does the
 * conversion to the "packed" format internally, depending on the current
 * framebuffer's color depth.
 * 
 * ## Usage of inline functions vs no-inline
 * 
 * Most of the rdpq APIs are defined as inline functions in the header rdpq.h,
 * but they then internally call some non-public function to do emit the command.
 * So basically the actual function is split in tow parts: an inlined part and
 * a non-inlined part.
 * 
 * The reason for this split is to help the compiler generate better code. In fact,
 * it is extremely common to call rdpq functions using many constant parameters,
 * and we want those constants to be propagated into the various bit shifts and masks
 * to be assembled into single words. Once the (often constant) arguments have been
 * handled, the rest of the operation can normally be performed in a separate
 * out-of-line function.
 * 
 * ## Sending commands to RDP
 * 
 * This section describes in general how the commands flow from CPU to RDP via RSP.
 * There are several different code-paths here depending on whether the command has
 * a fixup or not, and it is part of a block.
 * 
 * ### RDRAM vs XBUS
 * 
 * In general, the rdpq library sends the commands to RDP using a buffer in RDRAM.
 * The hardware feature called XBUS (which allows to send commands from RSP DMEM
 * to RDP directly) is not used or supported. There are a few reasons for this
 * architectural choice:
 * 
 *  * DMEM is limited (4K), RSP is fast and RDP is slow. Using XBUS means that
 *    you need to create a buffer in DMEM to hold the commands; as the buffer
 *    fills, RSP can trigger RDP to fetch from it, but in general RSP will
 *    generally be faster at filling it than RDP at executing it. At that point,
 *    as the buffer can't grow too much, the RSP will have to stall, slowing
 *    down the rspq queue, which in turns could also cause stalls on the CPU. The
 *    back-pressure from RDP would basically propagate to RSP and then CPU.
 *  * One of the main advantages of using XBUS is that there is no need to copy
 *    data from RSP to RDRAM, saving memory bandwidth. To partially cope up
 *    with it, rdpq has some other tricks up its sleeve to save memory
 *    bandwidth (specifically how it works in block mode, see below).
 * 
 * The buffer in RDRAM where RDP commands are enqueued by RSP is called
 * "RDP dynamic buffer". It is used as a ring buffer, so once full, it is
 * recycled, making sure not to overwrite commands that the RDP has not
 * executed yet.
 * 
 * ### RDP commands in standard mode
 * 
 * Let's check the workflow for a standard RDP command, that is one for which
 * rdpq provides no fixups:
 * 
 *  * CPU (application code): a call to a rdpq function is made (eg: #rdpq_load_block).
 *  * CPU (rdpq code): the implementation of #rdpq_load_block enqueues a rspq command
 *    for the rdpq overlay. This command has the same binary encoding of a real RDP
 *    LOAD_BLOCK command, while still being a valid rspq command following the rspq
 *    structure of overlay ID + command ID. In fact, the rdpq overlay is registered
 *    to cover 4 overlay IDs (0xC - 0xF), so that the whole RDP command space can be
 *    represented by it. In our example, the command is `0xF3`.
 *  * RSP (rspq code): later at some point, in parallel, the rspq engine will read
 *    the command `0xF3`, and dispatch it to the rdpq overlay.
 *  * RSP (rdpq code): the implementation for command `0xF3` is the same for all
 *    non-fixup commands: it writes the 8 bytes of the command into a temporary
 *    buffer in DMEM, and then sends it via DMA to the RDP dynamic buffer in RDRAM.
 *    This act of forwarding a command through CPU -> RSP -> RDP is called 
 *    "passthrough", and is implemented by `RDPQCmd_Passthrough8` and
 *    `RDPQCmd_Passthrough16` in the ucode (rsp_rdpq.S), and `RSPQ_RdpSend`
 *    in rsp_queue.inc.
 *  * RSP (rdpq code): after the DMA is finished, the RSP tells the RDP that
 *    a new command has been added to the dynamic buffer and can be executed
 *    whenever the RDP is ready. This is easily done by advancing the RDP
 *    `DP_END` register. When the buffer is finished, recycling it requires
 *    instead to write both `DP_START` and `DP_END`. See `RSPQCmd_RdpAppendBuffer`
 *    and `RSPQCmd_RdpSetBuffer` respectively.
 *   
 * ### RDP fixups in standard mode
 * 
 * Now let's see the workflow for a RDP fixup: these are the RDP commands which
 * are modified/tweaked by RSP to provide a more sane programming interface
 * to the programmer.
 * 
 *  * CPU (application code): a calls to a rdpq function is made (eg: #rdpq_set_scissor).
 *  * CPU (rdpq code): the implementation of #rdpq_set_scissor enqueues a rspq command
 *    for the rdpq overlay. This command does not need to have the same encoding of
 *    a real RDP command, but it is usually similar (to simplify work on the RSP).
 *    For instance, in our example the rdpq command is 0xD2, which is meaningless
 *    if sent to RDP, but has otherwise the same encoding of a real SET_SCISSOR
 *    (whose ID would be 0xED).
 *  * RSP (rspq code): later at some point, in parallel, the rspq engine will read
 *    the command `0xD2`, and dispatch it to the rdpq overlay.
 *  * RSP (rdpq code): the implementation for command `0xD2` is a RSP function called
 *    `RDPQCmd_SetScissorEx`. It inspects the RDP state to check the current cycle
 *    type and adapts the scissoring bounds if required. Then, it assembles a real
 *    SET_SCISSOR (with ID 0xD2) and calls `RSPQ_RdpSend` to send it to the RDP
 *    dynamic buffer.
 *  * RSP (rdpq code): after the DMA is finished, the RSP tells the RDP that
 *    a new command has been added to the dynamic buffer and can be executed
 *    whenever the RDP is ready.
 * 
 * The overall workflow is similar to the passthrough, but the command is
 * tweaked by RSP in the process.
 * 
 * ### RDP commands in block mode
 * 
 * In block mode, rdpq completely changes its way of operating. 
 * 
 * A rspq block (as described in rspq.c) is a buffer containing a sequence
 * of rspq commands that can be played back by RSP itself, with the CPU just
 * triggering it via #rspq_block_run. When using rdpq, the rspq block
 * contains one additional buffer: a "RDP static buffer", which contains
 * RDP commands.
 * 
 * At block creation time, in fact, RDP commands are not enqueued as
 * rspq commands, but are rather written into this separate buffer. The
 * goal is to avoid the passthrough overhead: since RDP commands don't change
 * during the block execution, they can be sent directly to RDP by RSP, 
 * referencing the RDP static buffer, without ever transferring them into
 * RSP DMEM and back.
 * 
 * Let's check the sequence at block compilation time:
 * 
 *  * CPU (application code): a call to 
 *  * CPU (application code): a call to a rdpq function is made (eg: #rdpq_load_block),
 *    while compiling a block.
 *  * CPU (rdpq code): the implementation of #rdpq_load_block detects that a block,
 *    is being compiled and does two things
 *    1) Append the RDP LOAD_BLOCK command to the RDP static buffer associated with the
 *       block.
 *    2) Write the #RSPQ_CMD_RDP_APPEND_BUFFER command to the rspq block, containing the
 *       address of the just-written LOAD_BLOCK command.
 * 
 * And now at block run time:
 * 
 *  * RSP (rspq code): the RSP reads the #RSPQ_CMD_RDP_APPEND_BUFFER command and
 * 
 * enqueues a rspq command
 *    for the rdpq overlay. This command does not need to have the same encoding of
 *    a real RDP command, but it is usually similar (to simplify work on the RSP).
 *    For instance, in our example the rdpq command is 0xD2, which is meaningless
 *    if sent to RDP, but has otherwise the same encoding of a real SET_SCISSOR
 *    (whose ID would be 0xED).
 *  * RSP (rspq code): later at some point, in parallel, the rspq engine will read
 *    the command `0xD2`, and dispatch it to the rdpq overlay.
 *  * RSP (rdpq code): the implementation for command `0xD2` is a RSP function called
 *    `RDPQCmd_SetScissorEx`. It inspects the RDP state to check the current cycle
 *    type and adapts the scissoring bounds if required. Then, it assembles a real
 *    SET_SCISSOR (with ID 0xD2) and calls `RSPQ_RdpSend` to send it to the RDP
 *    dynamic buffer.
 *  * RSP (rdpq code): after the DMA is finished, the RSP tells the RDP that
 *    a new command has been added to the dynamic buffer and can be executed
 *    whenever the RDP is ready.
 * 
 * ## Autosync engine
 * 
 * As explained above, the autosync engine is able to emit sync commands
 * (SYNC_PIPE, SYNC_TILE, SYNC_LOAD) automatically when necessary, liberating
 * the developer from this additional task. This section describes how it
 * works.
 * 
 * The autosync engine works around one simple abstraction and logic. There are
 * "hardware resources" that can be either "used" or "changed" (aka configured)
 * by RDP commands. If a resource is in use, a command changing it requires
 * a sync before. Each resource is tracked by one bit in a single 32-bit word
 * called the "autosync state".
 * 
 * The following resources are tracked:
 * 
 *  * Pipe. This is a generic resource encompassing all render mode and hardware
 *    register changes. It maps to a single bit (`AUTOSYNC_PIPE`). All render
 *    mode commands "change" this bit (eg: #rdpq_set_other_modes_raw or
 *    #rdpq_set_yuv_parms). All draw commands "use" this bit (eg: #rdpq_triangle).
 *    So for instance, if you draw a triangle, next #rdpq_set_mode_standard call will
 *    automatically issue a `SYNC_PIPE`.
 *  * Tiles. These are 8 resources (8 bits) mapping to the 8 tile descriptors
 *    in RDP hardware, used to describe textures. There is one bit per each descriptor
 *    (`AUTOSYNC_TILE(n)`) so that tracking is actually done at the single tile
 *    granularity. Commands modifying the tile descriptor (such as #rdpq_set_tile
 *    or #rdpq_load_tile) will "change" the resource corresponding for the affect tile.
 *    Commands drawing textured primitives (eg: #rdpq_texture_rectangle) will "use"
 *    the resource. For instance, calling #rdpq_texture_rectangle using #TILE4, and
 *    later calling #rdpq_load_tile on #TILE4 will cause a `SYNC_TILE` to be issued
 *    just before the `LOAD_TILE` command. Notice that if #rdpq_load_tile used
 *    #TILE5 instead, no `SYNC_TILE` would have been issued, assuming #TILE5 was 
 *    never used before. This means that having a logic to cycle through tile
 *    descriptors (instead of always using the same) will reduce the number of
 *    `SYNC_TILE` commands.
 *  * TMEM. Currently, the whole TMEM is tracking as a single resource (using
 *    the bit defined by `AUTOSYNC_TMEM(0)`. Any command that writes to TMEM
 *    (eg: #rdpq_load_block) will "change" the resource. Any command that reads
 *    from TMEM (eg: #rdpq_triangle with a texture) will "use" the resource.
 *    Writing to TMEM while something is reading requires a `SYNC_LOAD` command
 *    to be issued.
 * 
 * Note that there is a limit with the current implementation: the RDP can use
 * multiple tiles with a single command (eg: when using multi-texturing or LODs),
 * but we are not able to track that correctly: all drawing commands for now
 * assume that a single tile will be used. If this proves to be a problem, it is
 * always possible to call #rdpq_sync_tile to manually issue a sync.
 * 
 * Autosync also works with blocks, albeit conservatively. When recording
 * a block, it is not possible to know what the autosync state will be at the
 * point of call (and obviously, it could be called in different situations
 * with different states). The engine thus handles the worst case: at the
 * beginning of a block, it assumes that all resources are "in use". This might
 * cause some sync commands to be run in situations where it would not be
 * strictly required, but the performance impact is unlikely to be noticeable.
 * 
 * Autosync engine can be enabled or disabled via #rdpq_config_enable /
 * #rdpq_config_disable. Remember that manually issuing sync commands require
 * careful debugging on real hardware, as no emulator today is able to 
 * reproduce the effects of a missing sync command.
