 * @file backtrace.c
 * @brief Backtrace (call stack) support
 * @ingroup backtrace
 * 
 * This file contains the implementation of the backtrace support. See
 * backtrace.h for an overview of the API. Here follows some implementation
 * details.
 * 
 * Backtrace 
 * =========
 * MIPS ABIs do not generally provide a way to walk the stack, as the frame
 * pointer is not guaranteed to be present. It is possible to force its presence
 * via "-fno-omit-frame-pointer", but we tried to provide a solution that works
 * with standard compilation settings.
 * 
 * To perform backtracing, we scan the code backward starting from the return address
 * of each frame. While scanning, we note some special instructions that we look
 * for. The two main instructions that we look for are `sd ra, offset(sp)` which is
 * used to save the previous return address to the stack, and `addiu sp, sp, offset`
 * which creates the stack frame for the current function. When we find both, we know
 * how to get back to the previous frame. 
 * 
 * Notice that this also works through exceptions, as the exception handler does create
 * a stack frame exactly like a standard function (see inthandler.S). 
 * 
 * Only a few functions do use a frame pointer: those that allocate a runtime-calculated
 * amount of stack (eg: using alloca). Because of this, we actually look for usages
 * of the frame pointer register fp, and track those as well to be able to correctly
 * walk the stack in those cases.
 * 
 * Symbolization
 * =============
 * To symbolize the backtrace, we use a symbol table file (SYMT) that is generated
 * by the n64sym tool during the build process. The symbol table is put into the
 * rompak (see rompak_internal.h) and is structured in a way that can be queried
 * directly from ROM, without even allocating memory. This is especially useful
 * to provide backtrace in catastrophic situations where the heap is not available.
 * 
 * The symbol table file contains the source code references (function name, file name,
 * line number) for a number of addresses in the ROM. Since it would be impractical to
 * save information for all the addresses in the text segment, only special addresses
 * are saved: in particular, those where a function call is made (ie: the address of
 * JAL / JALR instructions), which are the ones that are commonly found in backtraces
 * and thus need to be symbolized. In addition to these, the symbol table contains
 * also information associated to the addresses that mark the start of each function,
 * so that it's always possible to infer the function a certain address belongs to.
 * 
 * Given that not all addresses are saved, it is important to provide accurate
 * source code references for stack frames that are interrupted by interrupts or 
 * exceptions; in those cases, the symbolization will simply return the function name
 * the addresses belongs to, without any source code reference.
 * 
 * To see more details on how the symbol table is structured in the ROM, see
 * #symtable_header_t and the source code of the n64sym tool.

/** 
 * @brief Symbol table file header
 * 
 * The SYMT file is made of three main tables:
 * 
 * * Address table: this is a sequence of 32-bit integers, each representing an address in the ROM.
 *   The table is sorted in ascending order to allow for binary search. Moreover, the lowest 2 bits
 *   of each address can store additional information: If bit 0 is set to 1, the address is the start
 *   of a function. If bit 1 is set to 1, the address is an inline duplicate. In fact, there might be
 *   multiple symbols at the same address for inlined functions, so we need one entry in this table
 *   for each entry; all of them will have the same address, and all but the last one will have bit
 *   1 set to 1.
 * * Symbol table: this is a sequence of symbol table entries, each representing a symbol. The size
 *   of this table (in number of entries) is exactly the same as the address table. In fact, each
 *   address of the address table can be thought of as an external member of this structure; it's
 *   split externally to allow for efficiency reasons. Each entry stores the function name, 
 *   the source file name and line number, and the binary offset of the symbol within the containing
 *   function.
 * * String table: this table can be thought as a large buffer holding all the strings needed by all
 *   symbol entries (function names and file names). Each symbol entry stores a string as an offset
 *   within the symbol table and a length. This allows to reuse the same string (or prefix thereof)
 *   multiple times. Notice that strings are not null terminated in the string table.
 * 
 * The SYMT file is generated by the n64sym tool during the build process.

/**
 * @brief Analyze a function to find out its stack frame layout and properties (useful for backtracing).
 * 
 * This function implements the core heuristic used by the backtrace engine. It analyzes the actual
 * code of a function in memory instruction by instruction, trying to find out whether the function
 * uses a stack frame or not, whether it uses a frame pointer, and where the return address is stored.
 * 
 * Since we do not have DWARF informations or similar metadata, we can just do educated guesses. A
 * mistake in the heuristic will result probably in a wrong backtrace from this point on.
 * 
 * The heuristic works as follows:
 * 
 *  * Most functions do have a stack frame. In fact, 99.99% of the functions you can find in a call stack
 *    must have a stack frame, because the only functions without a stack frame are leaf functions (functions
 *    that do not call other functions), which in turns can never be part of a stack trace.
 *  * The heuristic walks the function code backwards, looking for the stack frame. Specifically, it looks
 *    for an instruction saving the RA register to the stack (eg: `sd $ra, nn($sp)`), and an instruction
 *    creating the stack frame (eg: `addiu $sp, $sp, -nn`). Once both are found, the heuristic knows how to
 *    fill in `.stack_size` and `.ra_offset` fields of the function description structure, and it can stop.
 *  * Some functions also modify $fp (the frame pointer register): sometimes, they just use it as one additional
 *    free register, and other times they really use it as frame pointer. If the heuristic finds the
 *    instruction `move $fp, $sp`, it knows that the function uses $fp as frame pointer, and will mark
 *    the function as BT_FUNCTION_FRAMEPOINTER. In any case, the field `.fp_offset` will be filled in
 *    with the offset in the stack where $fp is stored, so that the backtrace engine can track the
 *    current value of the register in any case.
 *  * The 0.01% of the functions that do not have a stack frame but appear in the call stack are leaf
 *    functions interrupted by exceptions. Leaf functions pose two important problems: first, $ra is
 *    not saved into the stack so there is no way to know where to go back. Second, there is no clear
 *    indication where the function begins (as we normally stops analysis when we see the stack frame
 *    creation). So in this case the heuristic would fail. We rely thus on two hints coming from the caller:
 *    * First, we expect the caller to set from_exception=true, so that we know that we might potentially
 *      deal with a leaf function. 
 *    * Second, the caller should provide the function start address, so that we stop the analysis when
 *      we reach it, and mark the function as BT_LEAF.
 *    * If the function start address is not provided (because e.g. the symbol table was not found and
 *      thus we have no information about function starts), the last ditch heuristic is to look for
 *      the nops that are normally used to align the function start to the FUNCTION_ALIGNMENT boundary.
 *      Obviously this is a very fragile heuristic (it will fail if the function required no nops to be
 *      properly aligned), but it is the best we can do. Worst case, in this specific case of a leaf
 *      function interrupted by the exception, the stack trace will be wrong from this point on.
 * 
 * @param func                        Output function description structure
 * @param ptr                         Pointer to the function code at the point where the backtrace starts.
 *                                    This is normally the point where a JAL opcode is found, as we are walking
 *                                    up the call stack.
 * @param func_start                  Start of the function being analyzed. This is optional: the heuristic can work
 *                                    without this hint, but it is useful in certain situations (eg: to better
 *                                    walk up after an exception).
 * @param from_exception              If true, this function was interrupted by an exception. This is a hint that
 *                                    the function *might* even be a leaf function without a stack frame, and that
 *                                    we must use special heuristics for it.
