# Libdragon

[![Build](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=trunk)](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a simple library for N64 that allows one to code using the gcc compiler suite and nothing else. No proprietary library is needed.

See [docker wrapper](https://github.com/anacierdem/libdragon-docker) to quickly get libdragon up and running.

To get started from scratch, follow the following steps:

1. Create a directory and copy the `build-toolchain.sh` script there from the `tools/` directory.
2. Read the comments in the build script to see what additional packages are needed.
3. Run `./build-toolchain.sh` from the created directory, let it build and install the toolchain.
4. Install libpng-dev if not already installed.

*Below steps can also be executed by running `build.sh` at the top level.*

5. Install libdragon by typing `make install` at the top level.
6. Install the tools by typing `make tools-install` at the top level.
7. Install libmikmod for the examples using it. See `build.sh` at the top level for details.
8. Compile the examples by typing `make examples` at the top level.

You are now ready to run the examples on your N64.

# RSP assembly

Libdragon uses assembly macros to program the RSP chip defined in `ucode.S`. These mainly wrap `cop2`, `lwc2` and `swc2` instructions.

The syntax is similar to that of Nintendo's but with a few changes. For example if we take `vabs` instruction;

    vabs vd, vs, vt[e]

it becomes;

    vabs vd, vs, vt, e

and element (`e`) is always required. It is also similar for load/store instructions. As an example, `sbv` instruction;

    sbv vt[element], offset(base)

becomes;

    sbv vt, element, offset, base

Basically all operands are required and separated by commas.

While using these custom instructions, you should use `$v00`-`$v31` when naming vector registers and `$0`-`$31` when naming scalar registers.
