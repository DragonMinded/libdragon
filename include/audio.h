/**
 * @defgroup audio Audio Subsystem
 * @ingroup libdragon
 * @brief Interface to the N64 audio hardware.
 *
 * The audio subsystem handles queueing up chunks of audio data for
 * playback using the N64 audio DAC.  The audio subsystem handles
 * DMAing chunks of data to the audio DAC as well as audio callbacks
 * when there is room for another chunk to be written.  Buffer size
 * is calculated automatically based on the requested audio frequency.
 * The audio subsystem accomplishes this by interfacing with the audio
 * interface (AI) registers.
 *
 * Because the audio DAC is timed off of the system clock of the N64,
 * the audio subsystem needs to know what region the N64 is from.  This
 * is due to the fact that the system clock is timed differently for
 * PAL, NTSC and MPAL regions.  This is handled automatically by the
 * audio subsystem based on settings left by the bootloader.
 *
 * Code attempting to output audio on the N64 should initialize the
 * audio subsystem at the desired frequency and with the desired number
 * of buffers using #audio_init.  More audio buffers allows for smaller
 * chances of audio glitches but means that there will be more latency
 * in sound output.  When new data is available to be output, code should
 * check to see if there is room in the output buffers using
 * #audio_can_write.  Code can probe the current frequency and buffer
 * size using #audio_get_frequency and #audio_get_buffer_length respectively.
 * When there is additional room, code can add new data to the output
 * buffers using #audio_write.  Be careful as this is a blocking operation,
 * so if code doesn't check for adequate room first, this function will
 * not return until there is room and the samples have been written.
 * When all audio has been written, code should call #audio_close to shut
 * down the audio subsystem cleanly.
