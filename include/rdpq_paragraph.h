 * @brief Calculate the layout of a text using the specified parameters.
 * 
 * This function accepts UTF-8 encoded text. It will layout the text according
 * to the parameters provided in #rdpq_textparms_t, and return a new instance of
 * #rdpq_paragraph_t that can be used to later render the text via #rdpq_paragraph_render.
 * 
 * This function is useful if you want to layout a text once, and then draw
 * it multiple times (eg: for multiple frames). Layouting a text isn't
 * necessarily a slow operation (depending on what parameters are used), but
 * it's not free either.
 * 
 * This function is called internally by #rdpq_text_printn, #rdpq_text_printf, and #rdpq_text_print,
 * so it supports the same escape codes that they do, that allow to layout a
 * text using multiple fonts and styles.
 * 
 * The @p nbytes parameter is used to specify the number of bytes to layout.
 * It is then modified to provide the number of bytes actually consumed in the
 * input. The consumed bytes can be less than the input when the text is
 * truncated vertically (which requires the height to be specified in the @p parms
 * structure), which is useful to implement a pagination system. Notice that
 * horizontal truncation (as obtained using #WRAP_NONE
 * or #WRAP_ELLIPSES) still result in the whole line being consumed (as in
 * a paragraph, multiple lines could be truncated and thus shown only partially).
 * 
 * @param parms             Layout parameters
 * @param initial_font_id   Font ID to use to render the text (at least initially;
 *                          it can modified via escape codes). See #rdpq_text_printn
 *                          for more details.
 * @param utf8_text         Text to render, in UTF-8 encoding.
 * @param nbytes            Number of bytes in the text to render. On return, the number
 *                          of bytes consumed in the input.
 * @return                  Calculated layout. Free it with #rdpq_paragraph_free when not needed anymore.
