 * @brief Managed Controller Pak interface.
 *
 * The Controller Pak system is a subsystem of the @ref controller. Before attempting to
 * read from or write to a Controller Pak, be sure you have initialized the Joypad subsystem
 * with #joypad_init and verified that you have a Controller Pak in the correct controller
 * using #joypad_get_accessory_type.
 *
 * To read and write to the Controller Pak in an organized way compatible with official software,
 * first check that the Controller Pak is valid using #validate_mempak.  If the Controller Pak is
 * invalid, it will need to be formatted using #format_mempak.  Once the Controller Pak is
 * considered valid, existing notes can be enumerated using #get_mempak_entry.  To
 * read the data associated with a note, use #read_mempak_entry_data.  To write a
 * new note to the Controller Pak, use #write_mempak_entry_data.  Note that there is no append
 * functionality so if a note is being updated, ensure you have deleted the old note
 * first using #delete_mempak_entry.  Code should be careful to check how many blocks
 * are free before writing using #get_mempak_free_space.
