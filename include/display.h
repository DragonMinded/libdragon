/**
 * @defgroup display Display Subsystem
 * @ingroup libdragon
 * @brief Video interface system for configuring video output modes and displaying rendered
 *        graphics.
 *
 * The display subsystem handles interfacing with the video interface (VI)
 * and the hardware rasterizer (RDP) to allow software and hardware graphics
 * operations.  It consists of the @ref display, the @ref graphics and the
 * @ref rdp modules.  A separate module, the @ref console, provides a rudimentary
 * console for developers.  Only the display subsystem or the console can be
 * used at the same time.  However, commands to draw console text to the display
 * subsystem are available.
 *
 * The display subsystem module is responsible for initializing the proper video
 * mode for displaying 2D, 3D and software graphics.  To set up video on the N64,
 * code should call #display_init with the appropriate options.  Once the display
 * has been set, a surface can be requested from the display subsystem using
 * #display_get.  To draw to the acquired surface, code should use functions
 * present in the @ref graphics and the @ref rdp modules.  Once drawing to a surface
 * is complete, the rendered graphic can be displayed to the screen using 
 * #display_show.  Once code has finished rendering all graphics, #display_close can 
 * be used to shut down the display subsystem.
