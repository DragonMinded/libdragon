/**
 * @file ym64.h
 * @brief Player for the .YM64 module format (Arkos Tracker 2)
 * @ingroup mixer
 *
 * ym64player_t is a player of the .YM64 file format, which is based on the
 * .YM module format, a format first popularized in the Atari ST emulator scene.
 * 
 * The format is based around the very popular AY-3-8910 sound chip, that
 * was powering a few successful 8-bit consoles such as Atari ST, ZX Spectrum
 * and Amstrad CPC. It is a 3-channel PSG with envelope support. It can produce
 * typical 8-bit "chiptune" music scores. Nowadays, it is possible to compose
 * soundtracks using the Arkos Tracker 2 tool, that exports in the YM format.
 * 
 * The YM format is a simple dump of the state of all registers of the AY
 * chip at a fixed time step. To playback, it is necessary to emulate the
 * AY PSG. The implementation has been carefully optimized for the N64 MIPS
 * CPU for high-performance, so that playback typically takes less than 5%
 * of CPU time, plus a few percents of RSP time for resampling and mixing
 * (done by the mixer).
 * 
 * The YM64 is actually a valid YM file that has been simply normalized against
 * the different existing revisions, in a way to be efficient for reproduction
 * on N64. audioconv64 can convert YM to YM64 (or leave them as-is if they
 * already fully compatible).
 * 
 * The main conversion option to pay attention too is whether the output file
 * must be compressed or not. Compressed files are smaller but takes 18 KiB
 * more of RDRAM to be played back and cannot be seeked.
 * 
 * This player is dedicated to the late Sir Clive Sinclair whose computer,
 * powered by the AY-3-8910, helped popularize what we now call
 * chiptune music. -- Rasky
