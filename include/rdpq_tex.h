/**
 * @brief Load a texture into TMEM
 * 
 * This function helps loading a texture into TMEM, which normally involves:
 *  
 *   * Configuring a tile descriptor (via #rdpq_set_tile)
 *   * Setting the source texture image (via #rdpq_set_texture_image)
 *   * Loading the texture (via #rdpq_load_tile or #rdpq_load_block)
 * 
 * After calling this function, the specified tile descriptor will be ready
 * to be used in drawing primitives like #rdpq_triangle or #rdpq_texture_rectangle.
 * 
 * If the texture uses a palette (#FMT_CI8 or #FMT_CI4), the tile descriptor
 * will be by default pointing to palette 0. In the case of #FMT_CI4, this
 * might not be the correct palette; to specify a different palette number,
 * add .palette = X to the tex parms. Before drawing a texture with palette,
 * remember to call #rdpq_mode_tlut to activate palette mode.
 * 
 * If you want to load a portion of a texture rather than the full texture,
 * use #rdpq_tex_upload_sub, or alternatively create a sub-surface using
 * #surface_make_sub and pass it to #rdpq_tex_upload. See #rdpq_tex_upload_sub
 * for an example of both techniques.
 *

/**
 * @brief Load a portion of texture into TMEM
 * 
 * This function is similar to #rdpq_tex_upload, but only loads a portion of a texture
 * in TMEM. The portion is specified as a rectangle (with exclusive bounds) that must
 * be contained within the original texture.
 * 
 * Notice that, after calling this function, you must draw the polygon using texture
 * coordinates that are contained within the loaded ones. For instance:
 * 
 * @code{.c}
 *      // Load a 32x32 sprite starting at position (100,100) in the
 *      // "spritemap" surface.
 *      rdpq_tex_upload_sub(TILE2, spritemap, 0, 100, 100, 132, 132);
 * 
 *      // Draw the sprite. Notice that we must refer to it using the
 *      // original texture coordinates, even if just that portion is in TMEM.
 *      rdpq_texture_rectangle(TILE2,
 *          pos_x, pos_y, pos_x+32, pos_y+32,   // screen coordinates of the sprite
 *          100, 100,                           // texture coordinates
 *          1.0, 1.0);                          // texture increments (= no scaling)
 * @endcode
 * 
 * An alternative to this function is to call #surface_make_sub on the texture
 * to create a sub-surface, and then call rdpq_tex_upload on the sub-surface. 
 * The same data will be loaded into TMEM but this time the RDP ignores that
 * you are loading a portion of a larger texture:
 * 
 * @code{.c}
 *      // Create a sub-surface of spritemap texture. No memory allocations
 *      // or pixel copies are performed, this is just a rectangular "window"
 *      // into the original texture.
 *      surface_t hero = surface_make_sub(spritemap, 100, 100, 32, 32);
 * 
 *      // Load the sub-surface. Notice that the RDP is unaware that it is
 *      // a sub-surface; it will think that it is a whole texture.
 *      rdpq_tex_upload(TILE2, &hero, 0);
 * 
 *      // Draw the sprite. Notice that we must refer to it using
 *      // texture coordinates (0,0).
 *      rdpq_texture_rectangle(TILE2,
 *          pos_x, pos_y, pos_x+32, pos_y+32,   // screen coordinates of the sprite
 *          0, 0,                               // texture coordinates
 *          1.0, 1.0);                          // texture increments (= no scaling)
 * @endcode
 * 
 * The only limit of this second solution is that the sub-surface pointer must
 * be 8-byte aligned (like all RDP textures), so it can only be used if the
 * rectangle that needs to be loaded respects such constraint as well.
 * 
 *

/**
 * @brief Blit a surface to the active framebuffer
 * 
 * This is the highest level function for drawing an arbitrary-sized surface
 * to the screen, possibly scaling and rotating it.
 * 
 * It handles all the required steps to blit the entire contents of a surface
 * to the framebuffer, that is:
 * 
 *   * Logically split the surface in chunks that fit the TMEM
 *   * Calculate an appropriate scaling factor for each chunk
 *   * Load each chunk into TMEM (via #rdpq_tex_upload)
 *   * Draw each chunk to the framebuffer (via #rdpq_texture_rectangle or #rdpq_triangle)
 * 
 * Note that this function only performs the actual blits, it does not
 * configure the rendering mode or handle palettes. Before calling this
 * function, make sure to configure the render mode via
 * #rdpq_set_mode_standard (or #rdpq_set_mode_copy if no scaling and pixel
 * format conversion is required). If the surface uses a palette, you also
 * need to load the palette using #rdpq_tex_upload_tlut.
 * 
 * This function is able to perform many different complex transformations. The
 * implementation has been tuned to try to be as fast as possible for simple
 * blits, but it scales up nicely for more complex operations.
 * 
 * The parameters that describe the transformations to perform are passed in
 * the @p parms structure. The structure contains a lot of fields, but it has
 * been designed so that most of them can be simply initalized to zero to
 * disable advanced behaviors (and thus simply left unmentioned in an inline
 * initialization). 
 * 
 * For instance, this blits a large image to the screen, aligning it to the
 * top-left corner (eg: a splashscreen).
 * 
 * @code{.c}
 *     rdpq_tex_blit(splashscreen, 0, 0, NULL);
 * @endcode
 * 
 * This is the same, but the image will be centered on the screen. To do this,
 * we specify the center of the screen as position, and then we set the hotspost
 * of the image ("cx" and "cy" fields) to its center:
 * 
 * @code{.c}
 *      rdpq_tex_blit(splashscreen, 320/2, 160/2, &(rdpq_blitparms_t){
 *          .cx = splashscreen->width / 2,
 *          .cy = splashscreen->height / 2,
 *      });
 * @endcode
 * 
 * This examples scales a 64x64 image to 256x256, putting its center near the
 * top-left of the screen (so part of resulting image will be offscreen):
 * 
 * @code{.c}
 *      rdpq_tex_blit(splashscreen, 20, 20, &(rdpq_blitparms_t){
 *          .cx = splashscreen->width / 2, .cy = splashscreen->height / 2,
 *          .scale_x = 4.0f, .scale_y = 4.0f,
 *      });
 * @endcode
 * 
 * This example assumes that the surface is a spritemap with frames of size
 * 32x32. It selects the sprite at row 4, column 2, and draws it centered
 * at position 100,100 on the screen applying a rotation of 45 degrees around its center:
 * 
 * @code{.c}
 *     rdpq_tex_blit(splashscreen, 100, 100, &(rdpq_blitparms_t){
 *          .s0 = 32*2, .t0 = 32*4,
 *          .width = 32, .height = 32,
 *          .cx = 16, .cy = 16,
 *          .theta = M_PI/4,
 *     });
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @param surf           Surface to draw
 * @param x0             X coordinate on the framebuffer where to draw the surface
 * @param y0             Y coordinate on the framebuffer where to draw the surface
