 * @brief Real-time clock interface.
 * @author Christopher Bonhage
 *
 * The Joybus real-time clock is a cartridge peripheral that uses a battery
 * to power a clock that tracks the date, time, and day of the week. The
 * real-time clock keeps running even when the N64 is powered-off. The
 * Joybus RTC is accessed through the serial interface (SI) similar to EEPROM
 * and controllers. The Joybus RTC was only ever available on one official
 * cartridge that was only available in Japan: D≈çbutsu no Mori (Animal Forest).
 * Many emulators and flash carts include support for the Animal Forest RTC,
 * which makes it possible to include real-time clock functionality in homebrew!
 * There is also a real-time clock included in the N64DD hardware, which uses
 * a different interface and is not currently supported by libdragon.
 *
 * To check if the real-time clock is available, call #rtc_init.
 * To read the current time from the real-time clock, call #rtc_get.
 * Once the RTC subsystem is initialized, you can also use ISO C Time functions
 * to get the current time, for example: `time(NULL)` will return the number of
 * seconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970 at 00:00:00).
 * To check if the real-time clock supports writes, call #rtc_is_writable.
 * To write a new time to the real-time clock, call #rtc_set.
 *
 * This subsystem handles decoding and encoding the date/time from its internal
 * format into a struct called #rtc_time_t, which contains integer values for
 * year, month, day-of-month, day-of-week, hour, minute, and second.
 *
 * The Joybus RTC contains 3 "blocks" (or zones) which contain 8 bytes of data:
 * Block 0 contains a half-word control register and opaque calibration data.
 * Block 1 is unused and unsupported. See notes below.
 * Block 2 contains the current date/time as packed binary-coded decimal.
 *
 * Animal Forest did not use block 1 at all, so most emulators do not bother to
 * implement it. Theoretically, block 1 could be used as 8-bytes of SRAM-backed
 * storage, but this is not supported by libdragon's Real-Time Clock Subsystem.
 * If you need storage, consider using a standard cartridge save type or saving
 * to a Controller Pak.
 *
 * (As of July 2021) Joybus RTC does not work in combination with any EEPROM
 * save type on EverDrive64 3.0 or X7. To have the best compatibility and player
 * experience, it is not recommended to use the EEPROM + RTC ROM configuration.
 * This is a bug in the EverDrive64 firmware and not a system limitation imposed
 * by the Joybus protocol or Serial Interface.
 *
 * Unfortunately, since only one game ever used Joybus RTC (and that game was
 * later re-released on the GameCube in English), real-time clock support in
 * emulators and flash carts can be incomplete, inaccurate, or non-existent.
 * Many emulators do not actually implement the Joybus RTC write command and
 * always respond with the host device's current local time. Some emulators
 * and flash carts support writing to RTC but will not persist the date/time
 * after resetting or powering-off. You can run the `rtctest` example ROM on
 * your preferred emulator or flash cart to what RTC support is available.
 *
 * The only reliable way to check if writes are actually supported is to write
 * a time to the RTC and read the time back out. Many emulators that do
 * support RTC reads will silently ignore RTC writes. You should detect
 * whether writes are supported using #rtc_is_writable so that you can
 * conditionally show the option to change the time if it's supported. If the
 * RTC supports writes, it is safe to call #rtc_set to set the date and time.
 *
 * Due to the inaccurate and inconsistent behavior of RTC reproductions that
 * currently exist, this subsystem trades-off complete accuracy with the actual
 * Animal Forest RTC in favor of broader compatibility with the various quirks
 * and bugs that exist in real-world scenarios like emulators and flash carts.
 *
 * Some notable examples of RTC support in the ecosystem (as of July 2021):
 *
 * 64drive hw2 fully implements Joybus RTC including writes, but requires
 * delays after setting the time (see #JOYBUS_RTC_WRITE_FINISHED_DELAY).
 *
 * EverDrive64 3.0 and X7 partially support Joybus RTC, with caveats: The RTC
 * must be explicitly enabled in the OS or with a ROM header configuration;
 * RTC will not be detected if the EEPROM save type is used; RTC writes are
 * not supported through the SI, so changing the time must be done in the OS.
 *
 * UltraPIF fully implements an emulated Joybus RTC that can be accessed even
 * when the cartridge does not include the real-time clock circuitry.
 *
 * Special thanks to marshallh and jago85 for their hard work and research
 * reverse-engineering and documenting the inner-workings of the Joybus RTC.
