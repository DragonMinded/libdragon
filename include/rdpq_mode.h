 * @brief RDP Command queue: mode setting
 * @ingroup rdp
 * 
 * The mode API is a high level API to simplify mode setting with RDP. Configuring
 * render modes is possibly the most complex task with RDP programming, as the RDP
 * is full of hardware features that interact badly between them or are in general
 * non-orthogonal. The mode API tries to hide much of the complexity between an API
 * more similar to a modern graphic API like OpenGL.
 * 
 * In general, mode setting with RDP is performed via two commands SET_COMBINE_MODE
 * and SET_OTHER_MODES. These two commands are available as "raw" commands in the
 * basic rdpq API as #rdpq_set_combiner_raw and #rdpq_set_other_modes_raw. These
 * two functions set the specified configurations into the RDP hardware registers,
 * and do nothing else, so they can always be used to do manual RDP programming.
 * 
 * Instead, the mode API follows the following pattern:
 * 
 *   * First, one of the basic **render modes** must be set via one of
 *     the `rdpq_set_mode_*` functions.
 *   * Afterwards, it is possible to tweak the render mode by chang ing
 *     one or more **render states** via  `rdpq_mode_*` functions.
 * 
 * The rdpq mode API currently offers the following render modes:
 * 
 *   * **Standard** (#rdpq_set_mode_standard). This is the most basic and general
 *     render mode. It allows to use all RDP render states (that must be activated via the
 *     various `rdpq_mode_*` functions). 
 *   * **Copy** (#rdpq_set_mode_copy). This is a fast (4x) mode in which the RDP
 *     can perform fast blitting of textured rectangles (aka sprites). All texture
 *     formats are supported, and color 0 can be masked for transparency. Textures
 *     can be scaled and rotated, but not mirrored. Blending is not supported.
 *   * **Fill** (#rdpq_set_mode_fill). This is a fast (4x) mode in which the RDP
 *     is able to quickly fill a rectangular portion of the target buffer with a
 *     fixed color. It can be used to clear the screen. Blending is not supported.
 *   * **YUV** (#rdpq_set_mode_yuv). This is a render mode that can be used to
 *     blit YUV textures, converting them to RGB. Support for YUV textures in RDP
 *     does in fact require a specific render mode (you cannot use YUV textures
 *     otherwise). It is possible to decide whether to activate or not bilinear
 *     filtering, as it makes RDP 2x slow when used in this mode.
 * 
 * After setting the render mode, you can configure the render states. An important
 * implementation effort has been made to try and make the render states orthogonal,
 * so that each one can be toggled separately without inter-dependence (a task
 * which is particularly complex on the RDP hardware). Not all render states are
 * available in all modes, refer to the documentation of each render state for
 * further information.
 * 
 *   * Antialiasing (#rdpq_mode_antialias). Activate antialiasing on both internal
 *     and external edges.
 *   * Combiner (FIXME)
 *   * Blending (FIXME)
 *   * Fog (FIXME)
 *   * Dithering (#rdpq_mode_dithering). Activate dithering on either the RGB channels,
 *     the alpha channel, or both.
 *   * Alpha compare (#rdpq_mode_alphacompare). Activate alpha compare function using
 *     a fixed threshold.
 *   * Z-Override (#rdpq_mode_zoverride): Give a fixed Z value to a whole triangle or
 *     rectangle.
 *   * TLUT (#rdpq_mode_tlut): activate usage of palettes.
 *   * Filtering (#rdpq_mode_filter): activate bilinear filtering.
 * 
 * @note From a hardware perspective, rdpq handles automatically the "RDP cycle type".
 *       That is, it transparently switches from "1-cycle mode" to "2-cycle mode"
 *       whenever it is necessary. If you come from a RDP low-level programming
 *       background, it might be confusing at first because everything "just works"
 *       without needing to adjust settings any time you need to change a render state.
 * 
 * 
 * ## Mode setting stack
 * 
 * The mode API also keeps a small (4 entry) stack of mode configurations. This
 * allows client code to temporarily switch render mode and then get back to 
 * the previous mode, which helps modularizing the code.
 * 
 * To save the current render mode onto the stack, use #rdpq_mode_push. To restore
 * the previous render mode from the stack, use #rdpq_mode_pop.
 * 
 * Notice the mode settings being part of this stack are those which are configured
 * via the mode API functions itself (`rdpq_set_mode_*` and `rdpq_mode_*`). Anything
 * that doesn't go through the mode API is not saved/restored. For instance,
 * activating blending via #rdpq_mode_blender is saved onto the stack, whilst
 * changing the BLEND color register (via #rdpq_set_blend_color) is not, and you
 * can tell by the fact that the function called to configure it is not part of
 * the mode API.

/**
 * @brief Dithering configuration
 * 
 * RDP can optionally perform dithering on RGB and Alpha channel of the texture.
 * The dithering is performed by the blender unit, which is also in charge of
 * adapting the pixel color depth to that of the framebuffer. Dithering is
 * a good way to reduce the mach banding effect created by color depth
 * reduction.
 * 
 * The blender in fact will reduce the RGB components of the pixel (coming
 * from the color combiner) to 5-bit when the framebuffer is 16-bit. If the
 * framebuffer is 32-bit, the blender formula will be calculated with 8-bit
 * per channel, so no dithering is required.
 * 
 * On the other hand, the alpha channels (used as multiplicative factors
 * in the blender formulas) will always be reduced to 5-bit depth, even if
 * the framebuffer is 32-bit. If you see banding artifacts in transparency levels
 * of blended polygons, you may want to activate dithering on the alpha channel.
 * 
 * It is important to notice that the VI can optionally run an "dither filter"
 * on the final image, while sending it to the video output. This
 * algorithm tries to recover color depth precision by averaging lower bits
 * in neighborhood pixels, and reducing the small noise created by dithering.
 * #display_init currently activates it by default on all 16-bit display modes,
 * if passed #FILTERS_DEDITHER or #FILTERS_RESAMPLE_ANTIALIAS_DEDITHER.
 * 
 * If you are using an emulator, make sure it correctly emulates the VI
 * dither filter to judge the quality of the final image. For instance,
 * the RDP plugin parallel-RDP (based on Vulkan) emulates it very accurately,
 * so emulators like Ares, dgb-n64 or simple64 will produce a picture closer to
 * real hardware.
 * 
 * The supported dither algorithms are:
 * 
 *   * `SQUARE` (aka "magic square"). This is a custom dithering
 *     algorithm, designed to work best with the VI dither filter. When
 *     using it, the VI will reconstruct a virtually perfect 32-bit image
 *     even though the framebuffer is only 16-bit.
 *   * `BAYER`: standard Bayer dithering. This algorithm looks
 *     better than the magic square when the VI dither filter is disabled,
 *     or in some specific scenarios like large blended polygons. Make
 *     sure to test it as well.
 *   * `INVSQUARE` and `INVBAYER`: these are the same algorithms, but using
 *     an inverse (symmetrical) pattern. They can be selected for alpha
 *     channels to avoid making transparency phase with color dithering,
 *     which is sometimes awkward.
 *   * `NOISE`: random noise dithering. The dithering is performed
 *     by perturbing the lower bit of each pixel with random noise.
 *     This will create a specific visual effect as it changes from frame to
 *     frame even on still images; it is especially apparent when used on
 *     alpha channel as it can affect transparency. It is more commonly used
 *     as a graphic effect rather than an actual dithering.
 *   * `NONE`: disable dithering.
 * 
 * While the RDP hardware allows to configure different dither algorithms
 * for RGB and Alpha channels, unfortunately not all combinations are
 * available. This enumerator defines the available combinations. For
 * instance, #DITHER_BAYER_NOISE selects the Bayer dithering for the
 * RGB channels, and the noise dithering for alpha channel.

/**
 * @brief Configure the color combiner
 * 
 * This function allows to configure the color combiner formula to be used.
 * The color combiner is the internal RDP hardware unit that mixes inputs

 * that is then sent to the blender unit. If the blender is disabled (eg:
 * the polygon is solid), the value produced by the combiner is the one
 * that will be written into the framebuffer.
 * 
 * For common use cases, rdpq offers ready-to-use macros that you can pass

 * #RDPQ_COMBINER_TEX, #RDPQ_COMBINER_TEX_FLAT, #RDPQ_COMBINER_TEX_SHADE.
 * 
 * For example, to draw a texture rectangle modulated with a flat color:
 * 
 * @code{.c}
 *      // Reset to standard rendering mode.
 *      rdpq_set_mode_standard();
 * 
 *      // Configure the combiner
 *      rdpq_mode_combiner(RDPQ_COMBINER_TEX_FLAT);

 *      // Draw the rectangle
 *      rdpq_texture_rectangle(TILE4,
 *          0, 0, 32, 16,     // x0, y0, x1, y1
 *          0, 0, 1.0, 1.0f   // s, t, ds, dt
 *      );
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Alternatively, you can use your own combiner formulas, created with either
 * #RDPQ_COMBINER1 (one pass) or #RDPQ_COMBINER2 (two passes). See the respective
 * documentation for all the details on how to create a custom formula.
 * 
 * When using a custom formula, you must take into account that some render states
 * also rely on the combiner to work. Specifically:
 * 
 *  * Mipmap (#rdpq_mode_mipmap): when activating interpolated mipmapping
 *    (#MIPMAP_INTERPOLATE, also known as "trilinear filterig"), a dedicated
 *    color combiner pass is needed, so if you set a custom formula, it has to be
 *    a one-pass formula. Otherwise, a RSP assertion will trigger.
 *  * Fog (#rdpq_mode_fog): fogging is generally made by substituting the alpha
 *    component of the shade color with a depth value, which is then used in
 *    the blender formula (eg: #RDPQ_FOG_STANDARD). The only interaction with the
 *    color combiner is that the SHADE alpha component should not be used as
 *    a modulation factor in the combiner, otherwise you get wrong results
 *    (if you then use the alpha for blending). rdpq automatically adjusts
 *    standard combiners using shade (#RDPQ_COMBINER_SHADE and #RDPQ_COMBINER_TEX_SHADE)
 *    when fog is enabled, but for custom combiners it is up to the user to
 *    take care of that.
 * 
 * @param comb      The combiner formula to configure
 * 
 * @see #RDPQ_COMBINER1

 * 
 * @note For programmers with previous RDP programming experience: this function
 *       makes sure that the current cycle type can work correctly with the
 *       specified combiner formula. Specifically, it switches automatically
 *       between 1-cycle and 2-cycle depending on the formula being set and the

 *  * The T&L pipeline must calculate a depth information for each

 *    the per-vertex color. This is outside of the scope of rdpq,
 *    so rdpq assumes that this has already been done when
 *    #rdpq_mode_fog is called.
 *  * The RDP blender unit is programmed to modulate a "fog color"
 *    with the polygon pixel, using SHADE_ALPHA as interpolation
 *    factor. Since SHADE_ALPHA contains a depth information, the
 *    farther the object, the stronger it will assume the fog color.
 * 
 * To enable fog, pass #RDPQ_FOG_STANDARD to this function, and
 * call #rdpq_set_fog_color to configure the fog color. This is
 * the standard fogging formula. 
 * 
 * If you want, you can instead build a custom fogging formula
 * using #RDPQ_BLENDER. Notice that rdpq_mode assumes that the formula
 * that you set with rdpq_mode_fog does not blend with the background; for
 * that, use #rdpq_mode_blender.
 * 
 * To disable fog, call #rdpq_mode_fog passing 0.
 * 
 * @note Fogging uses one pass of the blender unit (the first),
 *       so this can coexist with a blending formula (#rdpq_mode_blender)
 *       as long as it's a single pass one (created via #RDPQ_BLENDER).
