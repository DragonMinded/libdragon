 * @defgroup mixer Audio mixer
 * @ingroup audio
 * @brief Flexible, composable, fast, RSP-based audio mixer.
 *
 * This module offers a flexible API to mix and play up to 32 independent audio
 * streams called "waveforms". It also supports resampling: each waveform can
 * play at a different playback frequency, which in turn can be different from
 * the final output frequency. The resampling and mixing is performed by a very
 * efficient RSP microcode (see rsp_mixer.S).
 *
 * The mixer exposes 32 channels that can be used to play different audio sources.
 * An audio source is called a "waveform", and is represented by the type
 * waveform_t. To be able to produce audio that can be mixed (eg: decompress
 * and playback a MP3 file), the decoder/player code must implement a waveform_t.
 *
 * waveform_t can be thought of as a "sample generator". The mixer does not force
 * the whole audio stream to be decompressed in memory before playing, but rather
 * work using callbacks: whenever new samples are required, a specific callback
 * (defined in the waveform_t instance) is called, and the callback is expected
 * to decompress and store a chunk of samples into a buffer provided by the mixer.
 * This allows full decoupling between the mixer and the different audio players.
 * Audio players are free to generate audio samples as they wish (eg: via RSP),
 * as long as they honor the waveform_t protocol. See waveform_t for more
 * information.
 *
 * One of the main design goals for the mixer is to provide an efficient way to
 * compose different audio sources. To achieve full flexibility without impacting
 * speed, the mixer tries to honor the "CPU zero copy" design principle: samples are
 * (almost) never touched or moved around with CPU. The whole API has been
 * carefully designed so that audio players can produce samples directly into
 * a mixer-provided buffer, so that the mixer can then resample and mix them on
 * the RSP and store the final output stream directly in the final buffer which
 * is sent via DMA to the N64 AI hardware DAC. In general, the N64 CPU is very
 * bandwidth-limited on RDRAM accesses, so "touching" 44100 samples per second
 * with the CPU would already consume too many resources. Audio players are
 * expected to use RSP to produce the audio samples as well, so that the full
 * audio pipeline can work totally off CPU.

 * WAVEFORMS
 *
 *********************************************************************/

/**
 * @brief Waveform callback function invoked by the mixer to read/generate samples.
 * 
 * WaveformRead is a callback function that will be invoked by the mixer
 * whenever a new unavailable portion of the waveform is requested.
 *
 * *wpos* indicates the absolute position in the waveform from which
 * the function must start reading, and *wlen* indicates the minimum number of
 * samples to read.
 *
 * The read function should push into the provided sample buffer
 * at least *wlen* samples, using #samplebuffer_append. Producing more samples
 * than requested is perfectly fine, they will be stored in the sample buffer
 * and remain available for later use. For instance, a compressed waveform
 * (eg: VADPCM) might decompress samples in blocks of fixed size, and thus
 * push full blocks into the sample buffer, to avoid decoding a block twice.
 *
 * On the contrary, producing less samples should only be done
 * if the read function has absolutely no way to produce more. This should
 * happen only when the stream is finished, and only when the waveform length
 * was unknown to the mixer (otherwise, the mixer won't ask more samples than
 * available in the first place).
 *
 * The argument *seeking* is a flag that indicates whether the read being
 * requested requires seeking or not. If *seeking* is false (most of the times),
 * it means that the current read is requesting samples which come immediately
 * after the ones that were last read; in other words, the implementation might
 * decide to ignore the *wpos* argument and simply continue decoding the audio
 * from the place were it last stopped. If *seeking* is true, instead, it means
 * that there was a jump in position that should be taken into account.
 *
 * Normally, a seeking is required in the following situations:
 *
 *   * At start (#mixer_ch_play): the first read issued by the mixer will
 *     be at position 0 with `seeking == true` (unless the waveform was
 *     already partially cached in the sample buffer's channel).
 *   * At user request (#mixer_ch_set_pos).
 *   * At loop: if a loop is specified in the waveform (`loop_len != 0`), the
 *     mixer will seek when required to execute the loop.
 *
 * Notice that producing more samples than requested in *wlen* might break
 * the 8-byte buffer alignment guarantee that #samplebuffer_append tries to
 * provide. For instance, if the read function is called requesting 24 samples,
 * but it produces 25 samples instead, the alignment in the buffer will be lost,
 * and next call to #samplebuffer_append will return an unaligned pointer.
 *
 * @param[in]  ctx     Opaque pointer that is provided as context to the function,
 *                     and is specified in the waveform.
