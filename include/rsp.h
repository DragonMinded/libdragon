 *    It is useful for the most basic cases where you want to write a ucode
 *    that has full control of the RSP.
 *    
 *  * rspq.h and rspq.c: RSP command queue for efficient task processing by

/**
 * @file rsp.h
 * @brief Low-level RSP hardware library
 * @ingroup rsp
 *
 * This library offers very low-level support for RSP programming. The goal
 * is to provide access to the hardware by exposing macros for all
 * hardware registers, provide a few simple helpers to load and run RSP
 * ucode (without any constraint or limitation on how the ucode should
 * be designed, how it should communicate with the CPU, etc.), and a few
 * debugging helpers to aid during development.
 * 
 * This documentation is not a guide to become a RSP programmer. It assumes
 * familiarity with RSP programming concepts and focus on explaining 
 * libdragon RSP support.
 * 
 * ## Ucode definition and loading
 * 
 * To define a RSP ucode, assuming you are using the n64.mk build system,
 * it is sufficient to do the following:
 * 
 *   1. Write your ucode in a file with extension `.S` and whose name starts
 *      with `rsp`. For instance `rsp_math.S`.
 *   2. Add the corresponding object file (`rsp_math.o`) in your Makefile in
 *      the list of dependencies for building your ROM, like all the other
 *      object files that come from C files.
 *   3. Declare the existence of the ucode in the source using #DEFINE_RSP_UCODE,
 *      for instance `DEFINE_RSP_UCODE(rsp_math)`.
 *      
 * At this point, you can load the ucode using #rsp_load and run it using
 * either #rsp_run, or #rsp_run_async (and later synchronize with #rsp_wait).
 * You can look at the `ucodetest` example which is a very minimal program
 * that does some RSP programming.
 * 
 * If you don't use n64.mk, you will have to come up with your own way to
 * load the ucode text and data segment into the ROM, and then either
 * define your own #rsp_ucode_t structure, or manually call the lower level
 * functions #rsp_load_code and #rsp_load_data.
 * 
 * ## Reading and writing data to RSP
 * 
 * To provide input and read output from the RSP, there are a few possible ways:
 * 
 *   1. Directly access RSP DMEM using the #SP_DMEM macro. The DMEM is memory
 *      mapped into the CPU address space, so it can be accessed directly.
 *      Only 32-bit reads and writes are supported. Note that you can only
 *      access DMEM while the RSP is not running.
 *   2. Run a DMA transfer using #rsp_load_data or #rsp_read_data. This is
 *      generally faster then accessing DMEM especially for larger transfers,
 *      but like all DMA transfers it requires the RDRAM buffer to be 8-byte
 *      aligned.
 *   3. Have the RSP do DMA transfers to and from RDRAM. This needs to be
 *      part of the ucode program.
 *  
 * ## RSP crashes
 * 
 * RSP does not have any concept of exception. So in general it is not possible
 * to tell whether something went wrong while running the ucode.
 * 
 * We define "RSP crash" any situation in which the RSP is behaving in an
 * unexpected way. For instance, it may have returned corrupted data, or have
 * stopped responding (eg: it is in an infinite loop), or has interrupted its
 * execution before providing a result (eg: a signal has not been set in the
 * status register).
 * 
 * When the CPU notices that the RSP may have crashed, it can invoke the
 * #rsp_crash function. This function interrupts the program showing a
 * crash screen that contains a full register dump, and then aborts execution,
 * so it must be used in non-recoverable situations. A even more complete dump
 * that includes also a full DMEM dump is sent via #debugf on the debugging spew
 * (see the debugging library to check how to hook up to it). A function
 * #rsp_crashf is also available in case the CPU wants to provide a message
 * on the symptom that was used to detect the RSP crash (eg:
 * `rsp_crashf("computed data is corrupted")`).
 * 
 * To help detect RSP crashes that involve timeouts, a macro #RSP_WAIT_LOOP
 * is available that can be used to implement CPU busy loops where the CPU
 * waits for the RSP to do something. The macro just simplifies the creation
 * of a loop with a timeout that calls #rsp_crash, the actual condition to
 * wait for is left to the caller for the maximum programming flexibility.
 * Notice that #rsp_wait and #rsp_run use #RSP_WAIT_LOOP internally with
 * a timeout of 500ms to wait for the RSP to finish execution of the ucode,
 * so using those APIs is enough to detect infinite loops in ucode execution
 * and trigger a RSP crash screen.
 * 
 * ## Custom ucode crash handlers
 * 
 * It may be useful to also dump ucode-specific information when the crash
 * screen is triggered. For instance, a ucode might want to dump on the
 * screen some important variable or buffers taken from DMEM, or even
 * reconstruct some state by looking at the registers. To do so, it is
 * possible to register a ucode-specific crash handler by filling the
 * `crash_handler` field in the #rsp_ucode_t structure (it can be done
 * either at runtime, or at compile-time when using the #DEFINE_RSP_UCODE
 * macro).
 * 
 * The crash handler will be called by the RSP crash screen and can either
 * add information on the screen (via printf) or dump them to the debugging
 * log (via debugf). It receives a #rsp_snapshot_t, which is a full snapshot
 * of the whole RSP state at the moment of crash, including all registers
 * (scalars and vectors), all COP0/COP2 registers, and the full IMEM and DMEM
 * contents.
 * 
 * ## RSP asserts
 * 
 * Since RSP debugging is quite complex due to the limited available
 * communication channels, it is advised to adopt defensive programming
 * while writing RSP ucode. The header file rsp.inc provides a set of 
 * assert macros that can be used in the RSP ucode to check for assumptions
 * and invariants, similar to the C assert. To use them, also include
 * the file rsp_assert.inc in your text segment.
 * 
 * When the RSP hits an assert, it enters an infinite loop, that will be
 * eventually detected by the CPU, triggering the RSP crash screen. Each
 * assertion can define a numeric assert code that will be shown in the
 * crash screen.
 * 
 * To further help with debugging, it is possible to register a custom
 * assert manager in the ucode. Similar to the crash handler, the assert
 * handler will be called when an assert is triggered and will be provided
 * with a #rsp_snapshot_t, and the assert code. The assert handler can be
 * used to parse the assert code and display a proper assert message (about
 * two lines of text). Since each assert is placed in a specific point in the
 * code, the assert handler can inspect the register contents at the point of
 * assertion to provide further information on the crash. Notice that the crash
 * handler will still be called also for asserts and remains the best place
 * where display a dump of the main internal data structures of the overlay.
 * 
 * The RSP assert macros are compiled away when NDEBUG is defined (just like
 * the C assert), so that it is possible to remove them from the final build
 * in case of memory constraints.
