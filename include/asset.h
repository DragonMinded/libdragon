/**
 * @defgroup asset Asset Subsystem
 * @ingroup libdragon
 * @brief Interfaces for loading assets from ROM or other supports
 * 
 * The asset subsystem is in charge of loading assets. Typically, assets
 * will be loaded from ROM, but other options might be possible (like SD
 * cards).
 * 
 * Asset filenames are always prefixed with a filesystem identifier which
 * has a syntax similar to an URL. For instance, to load a file from ROM
 * through the DragonFS filesystem, use a filename like "rom:/myfile.txt".
 * 
 * While it is possible to simply open asset files using fopen, which supports
 * the filesystem prefix as well, the asset subsystem provides a few helpers
 * around asset compression.
 * 
 * Assets can be optionally compressed using the mkasset tool. Asset compression
 * is done on a per-file basis (similar to how "gzip" works), and decompression
 * is transparent to the user. The asset subsystem will automatically detect
 * a compressed file and decompress it during loading.
 * 
 * The main functions for loading assets are #asset_load and #asset_fopen.
 * #asset_load loads the entire file into memory in one go, and it is useful
 * for small files or in general files that has to fully keep in RAM as-is.
 * The asset is transparently decompressed if needed.
 * 
 * Some files might require parsing during loading, and in that case,
 * #asset_fopen is provided. It returns a FILE* so that any kind of file 
 * operation can be performed on it, with transparent decompression.
 * Since it is not possible to seek in a compressed file, the FILE* returned
 * by #asset_fopen will assert on seek, even if the file is not compressed
 * (so that the user code will be ready for adding compression at any time).
 * 
 * If you know that the file will never be compressed and you absolutely need
 * to freely seek, simply use the standard fopen() function.
 *
