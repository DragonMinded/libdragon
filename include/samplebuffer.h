/**
 * samplebuffer_t is a circular buffer of samples. It is used by the mixer
 * to store and cache the samples required for playback on each channel.
 * The mixer creates a sample buffer for each initialized channel. The size
 * of the buffers is calculated for optimal playback, and might grow depending
 * on channel usage (what waveforms are played on each channel).
 *
 * The mixer follows a "pull" architecture. During mixer_poll, it will call
 * samplebuffer_get() to extract samples from the buffer. If the required
 * samples are not available, the sample buffer will callback the waveform
 * decoder to produce more samples, through the WaveformRead API. The
 * waveform read function will push samples into the buffer via samplebuffer_append,
 * so that they become available for the mixer. The decoder can be configured
 * with samplebuffer_set_decoder.
 *
 * The current implementation of samplebuffer does not achieve full zero copy,
 * because when the buffer is full, it is flushed and samples that need to 
 * be preserved (that is, already in the buffer but not yet played back) are
 * copied back at the beginning of the buffer with the CPU. This limitation
 * exists because the RSP ucode (rsp_audio.S) isn't currently able to "wrap around"
 * in the sample buffer. In future, this limitation could be lifted to achieve
 * full zero copy.
 *
 * The sample buffer tries to always stay 8-byte aligned to simplify operations
 * of decoders that might need to use DMA transfers (either PI DMA or RSP DMA).
 * To guarantee this property, #WaveformRead must collaborate by decoding
 * the requested number of samples. If WaveformRead decodes a different
 * number of samples, the alignment might be lost. Moreover, it always guarantees
 * that the buffer has the same 2-byte phase of the waveforms (that is, odd
 * samples of the waveforms are stored at odd addresses in memory); this is
 * the minimal property required by #dma_read (libdragon's optimized PI DMA
 * transfer for unaligned addresses).
 *
 * In general, the sample buffer assumes that the contained data is committed
 * to physical memory, not just CPU cache. It is responsibility of the client
 * to flush DMA cache (via data_cache_writeback) if samples are written
 * via CPU.
