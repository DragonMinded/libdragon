/**
 * @defgroup libdragon libdragon
 * @brief Low level runtime for homebrew development on the N64 platform.
 *
 * libdragon handles the hardware interfaces to the various systems in the N64.
 * The audio interface is handled by the @ref audio.  The controller interface,
 * controller peripheral interface and EEPROM interface are handled by the
 * @ref controller.  The display interface and RDP rasterizer are handled by
 * the @ref display.  System timers are handled by the @ref timer.
 * Low level interfaces such as interrupts, caching operations, exceptions and 
 * the DMA controller are handled by the @ref lowlevel.
 *
 * libdragon makes every effort to be self-sufficient and self-configured.  However,
 * when operating in unexpected environments such as with a non-6102 CIC, additional
 * setup may be required.  Please see the documentation for #sys_set_boot_cic to
 * inform libdragon of a nonstandard CIC.
