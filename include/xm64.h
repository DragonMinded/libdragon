/**
 * @file xm64.h
 * @brief Efficient XM module player
 * @ingroup mixer
 *
 * This module implements a player of the .XM64 file format, which is based on
 * the Fast Tracker II .XM module format.
 * 
 * The playback relies on the mixer (mixer.h), as it uses it to perform the
 * actual channel playing and mixing. It will use one mixer channel per each XM
 * channel. You need to initialize the mixer (via mixer_init) before using
 * xm64player_t.
 * 
 * The actual XM player is based on libxm (https://github.com/Artefact2/libxm),
 * a very fast and accurate XM player library that has been adapted for usage
 * in libdragon on N64. The main changes are:
 * 
 *   * Usage of the custom XM64 format. This formats is a serialization of the
 *     internal libxm context (`xm_context_t`), and allows us to do some required
 *     preprocessing (such as unrolling ping-pong loops which are not supported
 *     by the mixer), and to load the whole file with one single memory allocation
 *     to avoid heap fragmentation.
 *   * Loading of XM patterns is done on the fly rather than all in advance,
 *     to save RAM. Patterns are also recompressed using a RLE derivative which
 *     is more efficient and still fast to decompress.
 *   * Waveforms ("samples" in XM) are not preloaded, but they are streamed
 *     off disk when necessary, thanks to the mixer API that allows to do it
 *     very easily. This saves a lot of RAM.
 *   * The actual sample generation code of libxm is not used, as the playback
 *     code is based on the mixer. 
 *   * XM64 contains also the precalculated amount of sample buffer memory
 *     required for playing back, per each channel. This allows for precise
 *     memory allocations even within the mixer.
