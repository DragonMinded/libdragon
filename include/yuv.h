/**
 * @brief Convert YUV frames to RGB.
 * 
 * This library contains hardware-accelerated function to convert a YUV image
 * into a RGB image. The task is mainly performed using RDP, but the RSP can
 * also be used to handle parts of it.
 * 
 * It is possible to specify the exact colorspace to use for the conversions.
 * Colorspaces are represented using the #yuv_colorspace_t. A few standard
 * colorspaces are pre-defined as constants and can be used as-is:
 * 
 * - #YUV_BT601_TV: BT.601 colorspace, limited range (16-235) for CRT TVs.
 * - #YUV_BT601_FULL: BT.601 colorspace, full range (0-255)
 * - #YUV_BT709_TV: BT.709 colorspace, limited range (16-235) for CRT TVs.
 * - #YUV_BT709_FULL: BT.709 colorspace, full range (0-255)
 * 
 * Normally, most encoders default to #YUV_BT601_TV for videos at Nintendo 64
 * resolutions, while #YUV_BT709_FULL is typically the defaults for modern
 * HD or 4K videos.
 * 
 * If you have some very specific use case, you can define your own colorspace
 * using #yuv_new_colorspace. For testing purposes, #yuv_to_rgb can be used
 * to convert a single YUV pixel to RGB using a specified colorspace.
 * 
 * To blit a full frame, you can use #yuv_tex_blit, which is similar to 
 * #rdpq_tex_blit as it allows to copy an arbitrary sized frame and apply
 * transformations to it (typically, scaling or flipping).
 * 
 * To playback a video at maximum performance, it is recommended to use
 * #yuv_blitter_t instead. A blitter is an object that can be used to 
 * perform multiple frame conversions with the same parameters (same input
 * size, same output size, same scaling and alignment). It is similar to
 * #rdpq_tex_blit in concept, but it precalculates most of the computations
 * using a rspq block (see #rspq_block_t for more information), so that
 * any time a conversion is needed, it is completely offloaded to the RSP+RDP
 * with almost zero CPU overhead.
 * 
 * You can create a #yuv_blitter_t using #yuv_blitter_new (which accepts
 * parameters identical to #yuv_tex_blit), or the most handy #yuv_blitter_new_fmv
 * which accepts more high-level parameters more optimized for the use case
 * of a full-screen full motion video player.

 * @brief A YUV colorspace
 * 
 * This structure contains the parameters that define a YUV colorspace
 * for conversion to and from the RGB space. The "c" parameters are

 * the "k" parameters are used when doing a RDP-based conversion
 * (see all the yuv_draw_frame_* functions).
 * 
 * Most users can simply use one of the predefined colorspaces: #YUV_BT601_TV,
 * #YUV_BT601_FULL, #YUV_BT709_TV, #YUV_BT709_FULL. To simplify creating a custom
 * colorspace, #yuv_new_colorspace can be used.
 * 
 * When playing back a video, you should specify the colorspace that was used
 * to encode the video. Normally, this is available in the video header or 
 * stream as metadata information. Notice that most video encoders such as
 * ffmpeg default to ITU-R BT601 TV Range when encoding low resolution movies
 * (non-HD resolutions), so using #YUV_BT601_TV is a good default if the exact
 * colorspace is not known.
 * 
 * When encoding a video, it is suggested to configure the encoder to use
 * ITU-R BT601 TV Range. In general, colorspaces created in the "TV Range"
 * have more color fidelity when displayed on a CRT TV. For PC-only playback
 * through emulators, "Full Range" colorspaces offer more color precision.

 * from the mathematical definition of the colorspace. Most users will not need
 * to call this function and just use one of the predefined colorspaces such as
 * #YUV_BT601_TV.
 * 
 * A YUV colorspace is defined by three constants normally called Kr, Kg, Kb.
 * Since the sum of these three constants must be 1.0, normally only two are
 * provided (by convention, Kr and Kb).
 * 
 * Because of technical issues with old analog TVs, it was not possible to 
 * display the full 8-bit range of the Y,U,V components, so during the conversion
 * the range was often restricted a bit. The range for the Y component (as an
 * 8-bit unsigned integer) is defined via the minimum allowed value @p y0 and the
 * number of possible values @p yrange -- so the last allowed value is y0+yrange-1.
 * The range for the U,V components (as 8-bit signed integers) is specified in
 * @p crange and is always assumed to be centered around 0 (so the allowed values
 * are -crange/2 to crange/2-1).
 * 
 * For old TVs, colorspaces should use the "TV Range" which is defined as
 * y0=19, yrange=219, crange=224.
 * 
 * Videos meant to be played back on PC are probably coded using the "Full Range",
 * which is y0=0, yrange=256, crange=256.
