/**

 * @brief Hardware interfaces and libraries specific for the iQue Player
 * 
 * This module contains both lower-level hardware interfaces and higher-level
 * libraries that are specific to the iQue Player (also called "BB player").
 * It is a console that was released in China that is compatible with the
 * original N64 hardware while being faster (higher clock, faster RAM).
 * 
 * Libdragon supports iQue transparently: all ROMs built with libdragon will
 * also run on the iQue player without modifications (and be even faster!).
 * 
 * Given that the iQue player also has specific additional hardware components,
 * libdragon also features some libraries to access them and use them in your
 * programs (though, at that point, your program will not be compatible with
 * the original N64).
 * 
 * To perform a runtime check on what console the ROM is running, just use
 * the #sys_bbplayer function, that will return true when running on iQue.
