 * @brief RSP Command queue
 * @ingroup rsp
 * 
 * The RSP command queue library provides the basic infrastructure to allow
 * a very efficient use of the RSP coprocessor. On the CPU side, it implements
 * an API to enqueue "commands" to be executed by RSP into a ring buffer, that
 * is concurrently consumed by RSP in background. On the RSP side, it provides the
 * core loop that reads and execute the queue prepared by the CPU, and an
 * infrastructure to write "RSP overlays", that is libraries that plug upon
 * the RSP command queue to perform actual RSP jobs (eg: 3D graphics, audio, etc.).
 * 
 * The library is extremely efficient. It is designed for very high throughput
 * and low latency, as the RSP pulls by the queue concurrently as the CPU 
 * fills it. Through some complex synchronization paradigms, both CPU and RSP
 * run fully lockless, that is never need to explicitly synchronize with
 * each other (unless requested by the user). The CPU can keep filling the
 * queue and must only wait for RSP in case the queue becomes full; on the
 * other side, the RSP can keep processing the queue without ever talking to
 * the CPU.
 * 
 * The library has been designed to be able to enqueue thousands of RSP commands
 * per frame without its overhead to be measurable, which should be more than
 * enough for most use cases.
 * 
 * This documentation describes the API of the queue, and how to use it. For
 * details on how it is implemented, see the comments in rspq.c.
 * 
 * ## Commands
 * 
 * Each command in the queue is made by one or more 32-bit words (up to
 * #RSPQ_MAX_COMMAND_SIZE). The MSB of the first word is the command ID. The
 * higher 4 bits are called the "overlay ID" and identify the overlay that is
 * able to execute the command; the lower 4 bits are the command index, which
 * identify the command within the overlay. For instance, command ID 0x37 is
 * command index 7 in overlay 3.
 * 
 * As the RSP executes the queue, it will parse the command ID and dispatch
 * it for execution. When required, the RSP will automatically load the
 * RSP overlay needed to execute a command. In the previous example, the RSP
 * will load into IMEM/DMEM overlay 3 (unless it was already loaded) and then
 * dispatch command 7 to it.
 * 
 * ## Higher-level libraries and overlays
 * 
 * Higher-level libraries that come with their RSP ucode can be designed to
 * use the RSP command queue to efficiently coexist with all other RSP libraries
 * provided by libdragon. In fact, by using the overlay mechanism, each library
 * can obtain its own overlay ID, and enqueue commands to be executed by the
 * RSP through the same unique queue. Overlay IDs are allocated dynamically by
 * rspq in registration order, to avoid conflicts between libraries.
 * 
 * End-users can then use all these libraries at the same time, without having
 * to arrange for complex RSP synchronization, asynchronous execution or plan for
 * efficient context switching. In fact, they don't even need to be aware that
 * the libraries are using the RSP. Through the unified command queue,
 * the RSP can be used efficiently and effortlessly without idle time, nor
 * wasting CPU cycles waiting for completion of a task before switching to 
 * another one.
 * 
 * Higher-level libraries that are designed to use the RSP command queue must:
 * 
 *   * Call #rspq_init at initialization. The function can be called multiple
 *     times by different libraries, with no side-effect.
 *   * Call #rspq_overlay_register to register a #rsp_ucode_t as RSP command
 *     queue overlay, obtaining an overlay ID to use.
 *   * Provide higher-level APIs that, when required, call #rspq_write
 *     and #rspq_flush to enqueue commands for the RSP. For
 *     instance, a matrix library might provide a "matrix_mult" function that
 *     internally calls #rspq_write to enqueue a command
 *     for the RSP to perform the calculation.
 * 
 * Normally, end-users will not need to manually enqueue commands in the RSP
 * queue: they should only call higher-level APIs which internally do that.
 * 
 * ## Blocks
 * 
 * A block (#rspq_block_t) is a prerecorded sequence of RSP commands that can
 * be played back. Blocks can be created via #rspq_block_begin / #rspq_block_end,
 * and then executed by #rspq_block_run. It is also possible to do nested
 * calls (a block can call another block), up to 8 levels deep.
 * 
 * A block is very efficient to run because it is played back by the RSP itself.
 * The CPU just enqueues a single command that "calls" the block. It is thus
 * much faster than enqueuing the same commands every frame.
 * 
 * Blocks can be used by higher-level libraries as an internal tool to efficiently
 * drive the RSP (without having to repeat common sequence of commands), or
 * they can be used by end-users to record and replay batch of commands, similar
 * to OpenGL 1.x display lists.
 * 
 * Notice that this library does not support static (compile-time) blocks.
 * Blocks must always be created at runtime once (eg: at init time) before
 * being used.
 * 
 * ## Syncpoints
 * 
 * The RSP command queue is designed to be fully lockless, but sometimes it is
 * required to know when the RSP has actually executed an enqueued command or
 * not (eg: to use its result). To do so, this library offers a synchronization
 * primitive called "syncpoint" (#rspq_syncpoint_t). A syncpoint can be
 * created via #rspq_syncpoint_new and records the current writing position in the
 * queue. It is then possible to call #rspq_syncpoint_check to check whether
 * the RSP has reached that position, or #rspq_syncpoint_wait to wait for
 * the RSP to reach that position.
 * 
 * Syncpoints are implemented using RSP interrupts, so their overhead is small
 * but still measurable. They should not be abused.
 * 
 * ## High-priority queue
 * 
 * This library offers a mechanism to preempt the execution of RSP to give
 * priority to very urgent tasks: the high-priority queue. Since the
 * moment a high-priority queue is created via #rspq_highpri_begin, the RSP
 * immediately suspends execution of the command queue, and switches to
 * the high-priority queue, waiting for commands. All commands added via
 * standard APIs (#rspq_write) are then directed
 * to the high-priority queue, until #rspq_highpri_end is called. Once the
 * RSP has finished executing all the commands enqueue in the high-priority
 * queue, it resumes execution of the standard queue.
 * 
 * The net effect is that commands enqueued in the high-priority queue are
 * executed right away by the RSP, irrespective to whatever was currently
 * enqueued in the standard queue. This can be useful for running tasks that
 * require immediate execution, like for instance audio processing.
 * 
 * If required, it is possible to call #rspq_highpri_sync to wait for the
 * high-priority queue to be fully executed.
 * 
 * Notice that the RSP cannot be fully preempted, so switching to the high-priority
 * queue can only happen after a command has finished execution (before starting
 * the following one). This can have an effect on latency if a single command
 * has a very long execution time; RSP overlays should in general prefer
 * providing smaller, faster commands.
 * 
 * This feature should normally not be used by end-users, but by libraries
 * in which a very low latency of RSP execution is paramount to their workings.
 * 
 * ## RDP support
 * 
 * RSPQ contains a basic support for sending commands to RDP. It is meant
 * to collaborate with the RDPQ module for full RDP usage (see rdpq.h),
 * but it does provide some barebone support on its own.
 * 
 * In particulare, it allocates and handle two buffers (used with double
 * buffering) that hold RDP commands generated by RSPQ overlays, where 
 * commands are stored to be sent to RDP via DMA.
 * 
 * Overlays that generate RDP commands as part of their duty can call
 * the assembly API RSPQ_RdpSend that will take care of sending the
 * RDP commands via DMA into the RDRAM buffers (possibly swapping them
 * when they are full) and also tell the RDP to run them.
 * 
 * Notice that, while the RSP would allow also to send commands to RDP
 * directly via DMEM, this is deemed as inefficient in the grand picture:
 * DMEM in general is too small and would thus cause frequent stalls
 * (RSP waiting for the RDP to run the commands and buffers to flush);
 * at the same time, it is also hard to efficiently mix and match 
 * RDP buffers in DMEM and RDRAM, as that again can cause excessive
 * stalling. So for the time being, this mode of working is unsupported
 * by RSPQ.

/**
 * @brief Register a rspq overlay into the RSP queue engine.
 * 
 * This function registers a rspq overlay into the queue engine.
 * An overlay is a RSP ucode that has been written to be compatible with the
 * queue engine (see rsp_queue.inc for instructions) and is thus able to 
 * execute commands that are enqueued in the queue. An overlay doesn't have 
 * a single entry point: it exposes multiple functions bound to different

 * 
 * The function returns the overlay ID, which is the ID to use to enqueue
 * commands for this overlay. The overlay ID must be passed to #rspq_write
 * when adding new commands. rspq allows up to 16 overlays to be registered
 * simultaneously, as the overlay ID occupies the top 4 bits of each command.
 * The lower 4 bits specify the command ID, so in theory each overlay could
 * offer a maximum of 16 commands. To overcome this limitation, this function 
 * will reserve multiple consecutive IDs in case an overlay with more than 16
 * commands is registered. These additional IDs are silently occupied and
 * never need to be specified explicitly when queueing commands.
 * 
 * For example if an overlay with 32 commands were registered, this function
 * could return ID 0x60, and ID 0x70 would implicitly be reserved as well.
 * To queue the twenty first command of this overlay, you would write
 * `rspq_write(ovl_id, 0x14, ...)`, where `ovl_id` is the value that was returned
 * by this function.

 * @param      overlay_ucode  The overlay to register
 *
 * @return     The overlay ID that has been assigned to the overlay. Note that
 *             this value will be preshifted by 28 (eg: 0x60000000 for ID 6),

 * 
 * As explained in the top-level documentation, the overlay ID (4 bits) and the
 * command index (4 bits) are composed to form the command ID, and are stored
 * in the most significant byte of the first word. So, the first command argument
 * word, if provided, must have the upper MSB empty, to leave space
 * for the command ID itself.
 * 
 * For instance, assuming the overlay ID for an overlay called "gfx" is 1, 
 * `rspq_write(gfx_id, 0x2, 0x00FF2233)` is a correct call, which
 * writes `0x12FF2233` into the RSP queue; it will invoke command #2 in
 * overlay with ID 0x1, and the first word contains other 24 bits of arguments
 * that will be parsed by the RSP code. Instead, `rspq_write(gfx_id, 0x2, 0x11FF2233)`
 * is an invalid call because the MSB of the first word is non-zero, and thus
 * the highest byte "0x11" would clash with the overlay ID and command index.
 * 
 * `rspq_write(gfx_id, 0x2)` is a valid call, and equivalent to
 * `rspq_write(gfx_id, 0x2, 0x0)`. It will write `0x12000000` in the queue.
 * 
 * Notice that after a call to #rspq_write, the command might or might not
 * get executed by the RSP, depending on timing. If you want to make sure that
 * the command will be executed, use #rspq_flush. You can call #rspq_flush
 * after you have finished writing a batch of related commands. See #rspq_flush
 * documentation for more information.
 * 
 * #rspq_write allows to write a full command with a single call, which is
 * normally the easiest way to do it; it supports up to 16 argument words.
 * In case it is needed to assemble larger commands, see #rspq_write_begin
 * for an alternative API.
 *
 * @note Each command can be up to #RSPQ_MAX_SHORT_COMMAND_SIZE 32-bit words.

 *                       by #rspq_overlay_register.
