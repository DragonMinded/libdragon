#
# HOW TO WRITE AN OVERLAY:
#
# 1. Put `#include <rsp_queue.inc>` before any text or data
#    segments in your file.
# 2. Define the overlay header using RSPQ_BeginOverlayHeader
#    and RSPQ_EndOverlayHeader. The header must be placed at the
#    very beginning of your data segment.
# 3. Define some commands by placing calls to RSPQ_DefineCommand
#    in the header, one for each command. The functions that
#    your commands jump to can be located anywhere in your text segment.
#    At the end of each command function, you need to hand control
#    back over to the queue engine.
# 4. In the body of the function, respect the following rules with 
#    respects to register usage:
#    * The first 4 arguments of the function will be passed in
#      registers a0-a3. If your command needs more, you can use
#      the CMD_ADDR macro to fetch them (they are in DMEM but
#      need to be read). You can reuse a0-a3 as you wish in the
#      function body.
#    * "ra" regiser will point to RSPQ_Loop, which is the return point.
#      You can use "jr ra" to go back to the main loop, or simply
#      "j RSPQ_Loop" to jump there.
#    * "gp" register is the only reserved scalar register. If you
#      need to use it, you must save and restore its value
#      before jumping back to RSPQ_Loop.
#    * "$v00" register (alias: vzero) is initialized with 0. It is
#      used by the vcopy macro and is in general useful to have
#      around, but you can reuse it if you wish and there is no
#      need to restore it: the main loop will always zero it before
#      calling each command.
#    * "$v30" and "$v31" registers (alias: vshift and vshift8) contains
#      all powers of two (from 2 to 32768). The single elements are
#      also aliased using "KNN" macros (eg: K16 is vshift.e3). In addition
#      to being often useful in many calculations, they are also used
#      by the vector shift macros defined in rsp.inc (vsll, vsra, vsrl).
#      If you want, you can clobber these registers (obviously the macros
#      will not work anymore), and there is no need to restore them:
#      the main loop will always initialize them before calling each command.
# 5. This is how to use DMEM:
#    * The bss segment is useful to define empty space to use as buffers
#      (eg: to store data read via DMA). NOTE: contrary to C, the bss
#      segment is not initialized to zero, and is not preserved between
#      commands. Assume it contains random data when each command is called.
#    * The data segment is useful to define constant data that you might need
#      in the implementation of command. While the whole DMEM is also
#      writable, please do not do so, and assume that the data segment
#      might be restored to its original state at any time.
#    * Somewhere in your data segment, define the saved overlay
#      state using RSPQ_BeginSavedState and RSPQ_EndSavedState.
#      The save state is preserved across all calls to the overlay,
#      that is across different commands. This is the only part of
#      the data segement that you should consider writable.
#      NOTE: make sure to put at least one data directive that emits
#      a non-zero amount of bytes between them. If your overlay
#      doesn't need any data to be persisted, then use
#      RSPQ_EmptySavedState instead.
# 
# Read below for more details on how to use the macros mentioned above.
