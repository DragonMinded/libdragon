#
# HOW TO WRITE AN OVERLAY:
# 1. Put `#include <rsp_queue.inc>` before any text or data
#    segments in your file.
# 2. Define the overlay header using RSPQ_BeginOverlayHeader
#    and RSPQ_EndOverlayHeader. The header must be placed at the
#    very beginning of your data segment.
# 3. Define some commands by placing calls to RSPQ_DefineCommand
#    in the header, one for each command. The functions that
#    your commands jump to can be located anywhere in your text segment.
#    At the end of each command function, you need to hand control
#    back over to the queue engine. The return register will always
#    point to the main loop entry point when calling your commands,
#    so you can simply do this: `jr ra`. Instead, you can also 
#    explicitly jump there: `j RSPQ_Loop`.
# 4. Somewhere in your data segment, define the saved overlay
#    state using RSPQ_BeginSavedState and RSPQ_EndSavedState.
#    Make sure to put at least one data directive that emits
#    a non-zero amount of bytes between them. If your overlay
#    doesn't need any data to be persisted, then use
#    RSPQ_EmptySavedState instead.
# 
# Read below for more details on how to use the macros mentioned above.
#

# RSPQ_BeginOverlayHeader
