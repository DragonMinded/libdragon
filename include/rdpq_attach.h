 * @brief RDP Command queue: surface attachment API
 * @ingroup rdp
 * 
 * This module implements a higher level API for attaching surfaces to the RDP.
 * 
 * It offers a more common lock/unlock-style API to select render targets that help
 * catching mistakes compared to the raw commands such as #rdpq_set_color_image
 * or #rdpq_sync_full. 
 * 
 * Moreover, a small render target stack is kept internally so to make it easier to
 * temporarily switch rendering to an offscreen surface, and then restore the main
 * render target.

/**
 * @brief Attach the RDP to a color surface (and optionally a Z buffer)
 *
 * This function configures the new render targets the RDP will draw to. It accepts
 * both a color buffer and optionally a Z buffer, both of which in terms of
 * surface_t pointers.
 * 
 * For instance, it can be used with framebuffers acquired by calling #display_get,
 * or to render to an offscreen buffer created with #surface_alloc or #surface_make.
 * 
 * This function should be called before any rendering operations to ensure that the RDP
 * has a valid render target to operate on. 
 * 
 * The previous render targets are stored away in a small stack, so that they can be
 * restored later when #rdpq_detach is called. This allows to temporarily switch
 * rendering to an offscreen surface, and then restore the main render target.
 * 
 * @param[in] surf_color
 *            The surface to render to. Supported formats are: #FMT_RGBA32, #FMT_RGBA16,
 *            #FMT_CI8, #FMT_I8.
 * @param[in] surf_z
 *            The Z-buffer to render to (can be NULL if no Z-buffer is required).
 *            The only supported format is #FMT_RGBA16.

 * #rdpq_detach_show which basically schedules the #display_show to happen automatically
