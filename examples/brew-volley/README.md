# Brew Volley

This is a modified MULLER Marian's (tfmoe__) entry for the N64brew Game Jam #4 (a.k.a N64brew Summer Game Jam). Released as a Libdragon example with the permission from the author.

The game should be played with two controllers.

This example shows how one can easily build a simple game with unstable Libdragon SDK using RDPQ library.
