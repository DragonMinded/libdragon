- Distribution in binary form must not be misattributed, i.e. you must
  not claim (implicitly or explicitly) that you wrote it yourself.

  OverlapHeader.S, and the .bin and .dat files generated from them) in
  binary form as part of an Amiga executable is not restricted by this

  alongside the Shrinkler binaries in the official archives and has its
  own license stated inside the file.
